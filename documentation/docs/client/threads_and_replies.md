Threads and replies provide your users with a way to go into more detail about a specific topic. This can be very helpful to keep the conversation organized and reduce noise.

## Creating a Thread

To create a thread you simply send a message with a `parent_id`. Have a look at the example below:

```kotlin
val message = Message( 
    text = "Hello there!", 
    parentId = parentMessage.id, 
) 
 
// Send the message to the channel 
channelClient.sendMessage(message).enqueue { result -> 
    if (result.isSuccess) { 
        val sentMessage = result.data() 
    } else { 
        // Handle result.error() 
    } 
}
```

> If you specify `show_in_channel`, the message will be visible both in a thread of replies as well as the main channel.

Messages inside a thread can also have reactions, attachments and mention as any other message.

## Retrieving Thread Messages

Thread messages are separated from regular messages and won't be included in regular message response. In order to get messages from a particular thread - you need to pass parent message id in messages requests.

```
// Retrieve the first 20 messages inside the thread 
client.getReplies(parentMessage.id, limit = 20).enqueue { result -> 
    if (result.isSuccess) { 
        val replies: List<Message> = result.data() 
    } else { 
        // Handle result.error() 
    } 
} 
 
// Retrieve the 20 more messages before the message with id "42" 
client.getRepliesMore( 
    messageId = parentMessage.id, 
    firstId = "42", 
    limit = 20, 
).enqueue { /* ... */ }
```

## Quoting a Message

Instead of replying in a thread, it's also possible to quote a message. Quoting a message doesn't result in the creation of a thread; the message is quoted inline.

To quote a message, simply provide the `quoted_message_id` field when sending a message:

```kotlin
val message = Message( 
    text = "This message quotes another message!", 
    replyMessageId = originalMessage.id, 
) 
channelClient.sendMessage(message).enqueue { /* ... */ }
```

Based on the provided `quoted_message_id`, the `quoted_message` field is automatically enriched when querying channels with messages. Example response:

```xml
{ 
    "id": "message_with_quoted_message", 
    "text": "This is the first message that quotes another message", 
    "quoted_message_id": "first_message_id", 
    "quoted_message": {  
        "id": "first_message_id",  
        "text": "The initial message" 
    } 
}
```
