The `channel.sendImage` and `channel.sendFile` methods make it easy to upload files.

> This functionality defaults to using the Stream CDN. If you would like, you can easily change the logic to upload to your own CDN of choice.

> The maximum file size is 20mb for the Stream Chat CDN.

## Uploading an Image

```kotlin
val channelClient = client.channel("messaging", "general")

// Upload an image without detailed progress
channelClient.sendImage(imageFile).enqueue { result->
    if (result.isSuccess) {
        // Successful upload, you can now attach this image
        // to an message that you then send to a channel
        val imageUrl = result.data()
        val attachment = Attachment(
            type = "image",
            imageUrl = imageUrl,
        )
        val message = Message(
            attachments = mutableListOf(attachment),
        )
        channelClient.sendMessage(message).enqueue { /* ... */ }
    }
}
```

> **NOTE**: Attachments need to be linked to the message after the upload is completed.

## Uploading a File

```kotlin
// Upload a file, monitoring for progress with a ProgressCallback
channelClient.sendFile(anyOtherFile, object : ProgressCallback {
    override fun onSuccess(file: String) {
        val fileUrl = file
    }

    override fun onError(error: ChatError) {
        // Handle error
    }

    override fun onProgress(progress: Long) {
        // You can render the uploading progress here
    }
}).enqueue() // No callback passed to enqueue, as we'll get notified above anyway
```

## Customizing Upload Logic

The SDK allows you to use your own CDN by creating your own implementation of the `FileUploader` interface, and pass it to `ChatClient.Builder`.

The example below show how to change where files are uploaded:

```kotlin
// Set a custom FileUploader implementation when building your client
val client = ChatClient.Builder("39mr6a3z4tem", context)
    .fileUploader(MyFileUploader())
    .build()
}
```
