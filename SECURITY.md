Alternatively it is also possible to open a new issue in the affected repository, tagging it with the `security` tag.

A team member will acknowledge the vulnerability and will follow-up with more detailed information. A representative of the security team will be in touch if more information is needed.

# Information to include in a report
While we appreciate any information that you are willing to provide, please make sure to include the following:

* Be as descriptive as possible, the team will replicate the vulnerability before working on a fix.
