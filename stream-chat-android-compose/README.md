# Stream Chat Android Compose UI Components

This module contains reusable UI components built in Jetpack Compose, which you can use in combination with the [offline support](../stream-chat-android-offline) library. See the [Compose UI Components documentation](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/android/compose/overview/) for more info.
