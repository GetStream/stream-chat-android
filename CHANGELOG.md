### ⚠️ Changed
- 🚨 Breaking change: Added `cachedChannel` parameter to `ChatEventHandler::handleChatEvent` [#2807](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/2807)

## stream-chat-android-ui-components
### 🐞 Fixed
- Users' updates done in runtime are now propagated to the `MessageListView` component. [#2769](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/2769)

  - Italian
  - Japanese
  - Korean
  - Spanish
    You can disable them by explicitly setting `resConfigs` inside `build.gradle` file. Check our [docs](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/android/ui/guides/custom-translations/) for further details.
### ⚠️ Changed
- 🚨 Breaking change: Firebase dependencies have been extracted from our SDK. If you want to continue working with Firebase Push Notification you need to add `stream-chat-android-pushprovider-firebase` artifact to your App
  Check our [docs](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/android/client/guides/push-notifications/) for further details.
- Updated the Kotlin version to latest supported - `1.5.21`.

## stream-chat-android
### 🐞 Fixed
- Fixed markdown links rendering using custom linkify implementation.

## stream-chat-android-client
### ✅ Added
- `PushMessage` class created to store Push Notification data
- `PushDeviceGenerator` interface to obtain the Push Token and create the `Device`

### ⚠️ Changed
- `Device` class has an extra attribute with the `PushProvider` used on this device
- Breaking change: `ChatClient.setDevice()` and `ChatClient.addDevice()` now receive a `device` instance, instead of only receive the push provider token
- `RemoteMessage` from Firebase is not used anymore inside of our SDK, now it needs to be used with `PushMessage` class
- `NotificationConfig` has a new list of `PushDeviceGenerator` instance to be used for generating the Push Notification Token. If you were using `Firebase` as your Push Notification Provider, you need to add `FirebasePushDeviceGenerator` to your `NotificationConfig` object to continue working as before. `FirebasePushDeviceGenerator` receive by constructor the default `FirebaseMessaging` instance to be used, if you would like to use your own instance and no the default one, you can inject it by constructor. Unneeded Firebase properties have been removed from this class.

### ❌ Removed
- 🚨 Breaking change: Remove `ChatClient.isValidRemoteMessage()` method. It needs to be handled outside
- 🚨 Breaking change: Remove `ChatClient.handleRemoteMessage(RemoteMessage)`. Now it needs to be used `ChatClient.handlePushMessage(PushMessage)`

## stream-chat-android-offline

- Fixed markdown links rendering using custom linkify implementation.

### ✅ Added
- Added `MessageListView::setDeletedMessageListItemPredicate` function. It's responsible for adjusting visibility of the deleted `MessageListItem.MessageItem` elements.
- Added `streamUiAttachmentSelectionBackgroundColor` for configuring attachment's icon background in `AttachmentSelectionDialogFragment`
- Added `streamUiAttachmentSelectionAttachIcon` for configuring attach icon in `AttachmentSelectionDialogFragment`
- Added support for pinned messages:
  - Added a button to pin/unpin a message to the message options overlay
  - Added `MessageListView::setMessagePinHandler` and `MessageListView::setMessageUnpinHandler` methods to provide custom handlers for aforementioned button
  - Added `PinnedMessageListView` to display a list of pinned messages. The view is supposed to be used with `PinnedMessageListViewModel` and `PinnedMessageListViewModelFactory`
- Possibility to transform MessageItems before the are displayed in the screen.
  Use the `MessageListView.setMessageItemTransformer` for make the necessary transformation. This example makes groups of messages if they were created less than one hour apart:
```
binding.messageListView.setMessageItemTransformer { list ->
  list.mapIndexed { i, messageItem ->
        var newMessageItem = messageItem

        if (i < list.lastIndex) {
            val nextMessageItem = list[i + 1]

            if (messageItem is MessageListItem.MessageItem &&
                nextMessageItem is MessageListItem.MessageItem
            ) {
                val thisInstant = messageItem.message.createdAt?.time?.let(Instant::ofEpochMilli)
                val nextInstant = nextMessageItem.message.createdAt?.time?.let(Instant::ofEpochMilli)

                if (nextInstant?.isAfter(thisInstant?.plus(1, ChronoUnit.HOURS)) == true) {
                    newMessageItem = messageItem.copy(positions = listOf(MessageListItem.Position.BOTTOM))
                } else {
                    newMessageItem =
                        messageItem.copy(positions = messageItem.positions - MessageListItem.Position.BOTTOM)
                }
            }
        }

        newMessageItem
    }
}
```
- Added possibility to customize the appearance of pinned message in the`MessageListView` using the following attributes:
  - `streamUiPinMessageEnabled` - attribute to enable/disable "pin message" feature
  - `streamUiPinOptionIcon` - icon for pin message option
  - `streamUiUnpinOptionIcon` - icon for unpin message option
  - `streamUiPinnedMessageIndicatorTextSize`, `streamUiPinnedMessageIndicatorTextColor`, `streamUiPinnedMessageIndicatorTextFontAssets`, `streamUiPinnedMessageIndicatorTextFont`, `streamUiPinnedMessageIndicatorTextStyle` attributes to customize "pinned by" text
  - `streamUiPinnedMessageIndicatorIcon` - icon in the message list indicating that a message was pinned
  - `streamUiPinnedMessageBackgroundColor` - the background color of a pinned message in the message list
- Added possibility to customize `PinnedMessageListView` style using `streamUiPinnedMessageListStyle` theme attribute or `TransformStyle.pinnedMessageListViewStyleTransformer`. The list of available style attributes can be found in `attrs_pinned_message_list_view.xml`. The default style for `PinnedMessageListView` is `StreamUi.PinnedMessageList`.

### ⚠️ Changed
- 🚨 Breaking change: the deleted `MessageListItem.MessageItem` elements are now displayed by default to all the users. This default behavior can be customized using `MessageListView::setDeletedMessageListItemPredicate` function. This function takes an instance of `MessageListItemPredicate`. You can pass one of the following objects:
  * `DeletedMessageListItemPredicate.VisibleToEveryone`
  * `DeletedMessageListItemPredicate.NotVisibleToAnyone`
  * or `DeletedMessageListItemPredicate.VisibleToAuthorOnly`
    Alternatively you can pass your custom implementation by implementing the `MessageListItemPredicate` interface if you need to customize it more deeply.

- The `User` parameter in the `ChannelListHeader` is nullable and used to display the default leading content.

## stream-chat-android-pushprovider-firebase

  1. Add the artifact to your `build.gradle` file -> `implementation "io.getstream:stream-chat-android-pushprovider-firebase:$streamVersion"`
  2. Add `FirebaseDeviceGenerator` to your `NotificationConfig`
        ```
            val notificationConfig = NotificationConfig(
                [...]
                pushDeviceGenerators = listOf(FirebasePushDeviceGenerator())

  - Deprecated `ChatNotificationHandler.getFirebaseChannelIdKey`
  - Deprecated `ChatNotificationHandler.getFirebaseChannelTypeKey`

### ✅ Added
- Added `ChatClient::truncateChannel` and `ChannelClient::truncate` methods to remove messages from a channel.
- Added `DisconnectCause` to `DisconnectedEvent`
- Added method `SocketListener::onDisconnected(cause: DisconnectCause)`
- Added possibility to group notifications:
  - Notifications grouping is disabled by default and can be enabled using `NotificationConfig::shouldGroupNotifications`
  - If enabled, by default notifications are grouped by Channel's cid
  - Notifications grouping can be configured using `ChatNotificationHandler` and `NotificationConfig`
- Added `ChatNotificationHandler::getFirebaseMessaging()` method in place of `ChatNotificationHandler::getFirebaseInstanceId()`.
  It should be used now to fetch Firebase token in the following way: `handler.getFirebaseMessaging()?.token?.addOnCompleteListener {...}`.

### ⚠️ Changed
- Changed the return type of `FileUploader` methods from nullable string to `Result<String>`.
- Updated `firebase-messaging` library to the version `22.0.0`. Removed deprecated `FirebaseInstanceId` invocations from the project.

  - "Channel more" option is now not shown by default because we are not able to provide generic, default implementation for it.
    If you want to make this option visible, you need to set `app:streamUiChannelOptionsEnabled="true"` explicitly to `io.getstream.chat.android.ui.channel.list.ChannelListView` component.
  - "Channel delete" option has now default implementation. Clicking on the "delete" icon shows AlertDialog asking to confirm Channel deletion operation.

# May 11th, 2021 - 4.10.0
## stream-chat-android-client
### 🐞 Fixed

- Added `channel` field to the `NotificationInviteAcceptedEvent` event
- Added `channel` field to the `NotificationInviteRejectedEvent` event

### ⚠️ Changed
- **The client now uses a new serialization implementation by default**, which was [previously](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/releases/tag/4.8.0) available as an opt-in API.
  - This new implementation is more performant and greatly improves type safety in the networking code of the SDK.
  - If you experience any issues after upgrading to this version of the SDK, you can call `useNewSerialization(false)` when building your `ChatClient` to revert to using the old implementation. Note however that we'll be removing the old implementation soon, so please report any issues found.
  - To check if the new implementation is causing any failures in your app, enable error logging on `ChatClient` with the `logLevel` method, and look for the `NEW_SERIALIZATION_ERROR` tag in your logs while using the SDK.
- Made the `user` field in `channel.hidden` and `notification.invite_accepter` events non nullable.
- Updated channels state after `NotificationInviteRejectedEvent` or `NotificationInviteAcceptedEvent` is received

### ❌ Removed

  - `channel.created`
  - `channel.muted`
  - `channel.unmuted`

The SDK was providing message.cid and message.channel in some cases, but not always.

We recommend using one of these alternatives:

- message.cid if you just need a reference to the channel
- the channel object provided by client.queryChannel(s) if you need the full channel data
- channelController.channelData livedata object provided by the livedata package (automatically updated if channel data changes)
