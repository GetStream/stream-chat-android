    - Deprecated `ChatNotificationHandler.getFirebaseChannelIdKey`
    - Deprecated `ChatNotificationHandler.getFirebaseChannelTypeKey`

### ‚úÖ Added
- Added `ChatClient::truncateChannel` and `ChannelClient::truncate` methods to remove messages from a channel.
- Added `DisconnectCause` to `DisconnectedEvent`
- Added method `SocketListener::onDisconnected(cause: DisconnectCause)`

    - Notifications grouping is disabled by default and can be enabled using `NotificationConfig::shouldGroupNotifications`
    - If enabled, by default notifications are grouped by Channel's cid
    - Notifications grouping can be configured using `ChatNotificationHandler` and `NotificationConfig`
- Added `ChatNotificationHandler::getFirebaseMessaging()` method in place of `ChatNotificationHandler::getFirebaseInstanceId()`.
It should be used now to fetch Firebase token in the following way: `handler.getFirebaseMessaging()?.token?.addOnCompleteListener {...}`.

    - "Channel more" option is now not shown by default because we are not able to provide generic, default implementation for it.
    If you want to make this option visible, you need to set `app:streamUiChannelOptionsEnabled="true"` explicitly to `io.getstream.chat.android.ui.channel.list.ChannelListView` component.
    - "Channel delete" option has now default implementation. Clicking on the "delete" icon shows AlertDialog asking to confirm Channel deletion operation.

- `notification.channel_deleted`
- Added `channel` field to the `NotificationInviteAcceptedEvent` event
- Added `channel` field to the `NotificationInviteRejectedEvent` event

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Changed
- **The client now uses a new serialization implementation by default**, which was [previously](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/releases/tag/4.8.0) available as an opt-in API.
    - This new implementation is more performant and greatly improves type safety in the networking code of the SDK.
    - If you experience any issues after upgrading to this version of the SDK, you can call `useNewSerialization(false)` when building your `ChatClient` to revert to using the old implementation. Note however that we'll be removing the old implementation soon, so please report any issues found.
    - To check if the new implementation is causing any failures in your app, enable error logging on `ChatClient` with the `logLevel` method, and look for the `NEW_SERIALIZATION_ERROR` tag in your logs while using the SDK.
- Made the `user` field in `channel.hidden` and `notification.invite_accepter` events non nullable.
- Updated channels state after `NotificationInviteRejectedEvent` or `NotificationInviteAcceptedEvent` is received

# 1.16.0 - Wed 23 Sep 2020 (stream-chat-android-client)
- Removed message.channel, this is a backwards incompatible change
- Ensure that message.cid is always available

The SDK was providing message.cid and message.channel in some cases, but not always.
Code that relied on those fields being populated caused bugs in production.

If you were relying on message.channel it's likely that you were running into bugs.
We recommend using one of these alternatives:

- message.cid if you just need a reference to the channel
- the channel object provided by client.queryChannel(s) if you need the full channel data
- channelController.channelData livedata object provided by the livedata package (automatically updated if channel data changes)
- channelController.toChannel() function provided by the livedata package
