### ⬆️ Improved
- Reviewed requests parameters. `connectionId` is now sent only if necessary. [#4138](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4138)

### ❌ Removed
- 🚨 Breaking change: Removed `connectionId` parameter from `FileUploader` methods. [#4138](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4138)

## stream-chat-android-state
### ⚠️ Changed
- Divided QueryChannelLogic into state and database. [#4156](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4156)

## stream-chat-android-compose
### ✅ Added
- Added `ownMessageText` and `otherMessageText` to `StreamColors` to enable message text customization. If you have been using `StreamColors.textHighEmphasis` to customize the color of the message texts, we recommend switching to the new attributes instead. [#4175](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4175)

# September 13th, 2022 - 5.10.0
## stream-chat-android-client
### ⬆️ Improved
- Improving precision in time in the endpoint that syncs information between SDK and Stream's backend to make sure that undesired events are not coming due to a incorrect round down in time or desired events are not being ignored due to a incorrect round up of time when serializing/desirializing time in the SDK. [#4102](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4102)

### ✅ Added
- Added `ChatEvent.rawDate` to access the time of an event as it was sent by the backend. This class includes microseconds precision and can be used when a higher precision than miliseconds is desired. [#4102](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4102)
- Added [Handling User Connection](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/android/client/guides/handling-user-connection/) guide. [#4131](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4131)
- Supported Android 13 behaviour changes. [#4039](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4039)

## stream-chat-android-state
### 🐞 Fixed
- Fixed incrementing unread count if the message is already in the state. [#4135](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4135)

## stream-chat-android-ui-common
### ⬆️ Improved
- Improved slow mode countdown which is now started only after the message is sent to the server. [#4120](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4120)

## stream-chat-android-ui-components
### ⬆️ Improved
- Clicking or long clicking on the white spaces next to messages will no longer trigger listeners, from now on, only clicking on the actual message containers will. [#4151](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4151)

### ✅ Added
- Added the `MessageListView::showMessageOptionsDialog` method to show message options dialog. [#4127](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4127)
- Added styled attribute `streamUiGiphyMediaAttachmentSizingMode` and it's programmatic counterpart `GiphyMediaAttachmentViewStyle.sizingMode`. This parameters controls the way Giphy containers resize themselves. For a care free experience use adaptive resizing which will intelligently adapt its size while respecting the gif's aspect ratio. We recommend using adaptive resizing, however if you require more control use manual mode. [#4134](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4134)
- Added styled attributes `streamUiGiphyMediaAttachmentWidth`, `streamUiGiphyMediaAttachmentHeight`, `streamUiGiphyMediaAttachmentDimensionRatio` and their programmatic counterparts contained within `GiphyMediaAttachmentViewStyle` that are `width`, `height` and `dimensionRatio`. These values are used to exert more control over Giphys. They are ignored if sizing mode is set to adaptive and respected if it is set to manual. [#4134](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4134)

### ⚠️ Changed
- Exposed `MessageOptionsDialogFragment` so that clients are able to create and show the dialog manually. [#4127](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4127)
- 🚨 Breaking change: `streamUiGiphyMediaAttachmentGiphyType` and its programmatic counterpart `GiphyMediaAttachmentViewStyle.giphyType` no longer change the container size. Container sizing has been decoupled from giphy scale type which now only controls the quality of the gif itself. If you need fixed sizes, set the sizing mode to manual and manipulate the container by setting custom width, height and if needed dimension ratio and scale type. Please check the added section for the full names of the new attributes. [#4134](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4134)

## stream-chat-android-compose
### ⬆️ Improved
- Improved the way Giphy attachments are displayed. Instead of being cropped they can now be set to either respect the Giphy attachment's aspect ratio and adaptively resize themselves automatically or be manually sized in a fixed way by the user. [#4027](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4027)
- Added the ability to control Giphy quality, sizing mode and content scaling by adding the parameters `GiphyInfoType` (controls quality), `GiphySizingMode` (controls sizing) and `contentScale` (controls scaling) to the functions `StreamAttachmentFactories.defaultFactories()`, `GiphyAttachmentFactory()` and `GiphyAttachmentContent()`. [#4027](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4027)

### ✅ Added
- Added `GiphySizingMode`, an enum class used to control the way Giphys are displayed. When `GiphySizingMode.ADAPTIVE` is passed in as an argument it will make Giphy automatically resize themselves to fill available space while respecting their original aspect ratios, while `GiphySizingMode.FIXED_SIZE` will allow you to manually control the dimensions of the Giphy container in a fixed size manner. You can clip the maximum height and width in both cases by modifying `ChatTheme.attachmentsContentGiphyMaxWidth` and `attachmentsContentGiphyMaxHeight`. `GiphySizingMode` can be passed in as an argument to the following functions: `StreamAttachmentFactories.defaultFactories()`, `GiphyAttachmentFactory()` and `GiphyAttachmentContent()`. [#4027](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4027)
- Added parameters `attachmentsContentGiphyMaxWidth` and `attachmentsContentGiphyMaxHeight` to `StreamDimens`. These parameters can be used to control the maximum dimensions of Giphys in either sizing mode. [#4027](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4027)

# August 30th, 2022 - 5.9.0
## stream-chat-android-client
### ⬆️ Improved
- Show rounded avatars on Push Notification when `MessagingStyleNotificationHandler` is used. [#4059](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4059)
- Add an option to use a custom implementation when showing avatars on Push Notifications when `MessagingStyleNotificationHandler` is used. [#4069](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4069)

### ✅ Added
- Method to switch between users `ChatClient.switchUser`. Can be used for switching between users to simplify code for disconnecting and connecting to the SDK. [#4018](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4018)
- Added `UploadedFile` which represents an uploaded file. It contains the url to the file under the property `file`, and a thumbnail of the file under the property `thumbUrl`. Thumbnails are usually returned when uploading a video file. [#4058](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4058)

### ⚠️ Changed
- 🚨 Breaking change: `ChatClient.sendFile` now returns `UploadedFile` instead of `String`. `UploadedFile.file` is the equivalent of the previous return value. If you do not need the other parts of `UploadedFile`, you can use `.map { it.file }` to mitigate the breaking change. [#4058](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4058)
- 🚨 Breaking change: `ChannelClient.sendFile` now returns `UploadedFile` instead of `String`. `UploadedFile.file` is the equivalent of the previous return value. If you do not need the other parts of `UploadedFile`, you can use `.map { it.file }` to mitigate the breaking change. [#4058](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4058)
- 🚨 Breaking change: Overloaded functions `FileUploader.sendFile()` have had their signatures changed. Instead of returning `String`, they are now supposed to return `UploadedFile`. If you have extended this interface and only need the previous return functionality, you can assign a value to `UploadedFile.file` while keeping `UploadedFile.thumbUrl` `null`. [#4058](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4058)
- 🚨 Breaking change: Overloaded functions `StreamFileUploader.sendFile()` have had their signatures changed. Instead of returning `String`, they now return `UploadedFile`. If you do not need the other parts of `UploadedFile`, you can use `.map { it.file }` to mitigate the breaking change. [#4058](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4058)
- 🚨 Breaking change: `ChatClient.sendImage` now returns `UploadedImage` instead of `String`. `UploadedImage.file` is the equivalent of the previous return value, you can use `.map { it.file }` to mitigate the breaking change. [#4058](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4058)
- 🚨 Breaking change: `ChannelClient.sendImage` now returns `UploadedImage` instead of `String`. `UploadedImage.file` is the equivalent of the previous return value, you can use `.map { it.file }` to mitigate the breaking change. [#4058](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4058)
- 🚨 Breaking change: Overloaded functions `FileUploader.sendImage()` have had their signatures changed. Instead of returning `String`, they are now supposed to return `UploadedImage`. To mitigate these changes, you can wrap your previously returned file URL inside `UploadedImage`. [#4058](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4058)
- 🚨 Breaking change: Overloaded functions `StreamFileUploader.sendImage()` have had their signatures changed. Instead of returning `String`, they now return `UploadedImage`, you can use `.map { it.file }` to mitigate the breaking change. [#4058](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4058)

## stream-chat-android-ui-common
### ✅ Added
- Added `hasCommands` field to `MessageComposerState` to set commands button visibility. [#4057](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4057)
- Add an implementation of `UserIconBuilder` which uses Coil to load the avatar picture. [#4069](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4069)

- Now "Quotes" toggle in the dashboard controls the "Reply" option in the message list. [#4074](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4074)
- Now "Threads & Replies" toggle in the dashboard controls the "Thread Reply" option in the message list. [#4074](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4074)
- Fixed a bug that made `MessageInputView` not adhere to integration visibility attributes (`streamUiAttachButtonEnabled` and `streamUiLightningButtonEnabled`). [#4107](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4107)
- Fixed scroll state on filter change. [#4105](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4105/files)

- Integration button visibility inside `MessageComposerView` dictated by attributes `streamUiMessageComposerCommandsButtonVisible` and `streamUiMessageComposerAttachmentsButtonVisible` is now set prior to binding the ViewModel, improving compliance and possible flickering issues. [#4107](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4107)

### ✅ Added
- Added the `stream-chat-android-ui-guides` application that showcases different customizations of the SDK. [#4024](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4024)

### ⚠️ Changed
- 🚨 Breaking change: `ChannelListUpdateListener` is now tasked with scrolling the list to the bottom once the `ChannelListItem.LoadingMoreItem` is inserted after requesting a new page of `Channel`s. If `ChannelListUpdateListener` inside `ChannelListView` is overridden in order to keep the scroll to bottom when loading a new page please copy the default implementation to the custom implementation of the listener. [#4105](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4105/files)

## stream-chat-android-compose

## stream-chat-android-ui-components
### 🐞 Fixed
- Fixed loading of image attachments with null values of `Attachment.originalWidth` and `Attachment.originalHeight`.

- 🚨 Breaking change: `ChatEventHandlerFactory::chatEventHandler` signature was changed. It now requires `StateFlow<Map<String, Channel>?>` instead of `StateFlow<List<Channel>?>` [#3992](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/3992)
- Added additional `chatEventHandlerFactory` parameter to `ChatClient.queryChannelsAsState` which allows you to customize `chatEventHandler` associated with the query. [#3992](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/3992)

## stream-chat-android-ui-components
### 🐞 Fixed
- Fixed a crash when passing content URIs without duration metadata to the `StorageHelper::.getAttachmentsFromUriList` method. [4002](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4002)
- Image attachment containers now posses the correct fixed size prior to loading, avoiding message items around messages containing images from "jumping". This is applicable only to image attachments which contain non-null values`Attachment.originalWidth` and `Attachment.originalHeight` properties. [#4011](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4011)
- Fixed a bug when a reaction left by the current user appears as a reaction left by some other user. [4035#](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4035)

- Fixed a bug when a reaction left by the current user appears as a reaction left by some other user. [4035#](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4035)

### ⬆️ Improved
- `ImageAttachmentContent` is no longer statically sized. It now auto-sizes itself according to the image attachment dimension ratio. If you wish to limit the maximum height of image attachments, please use `StreamDimens.attachmentsContentImageMaxHeight`.  [#4013](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4013)

### ✅ Added
- Added additional `chatEventHandlerFactory` parameter to `ChannelListViewModel` and `ChannelListViewModelFactory` that allows customizing `ChatEventHandler`. [#3997](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/3997)

### ⚠️ Changed
- `StreamDimens` constructor containing parameter `attachmentsContentImageHeight` has been deprecated. Please use the one without it. This has been done because images displayed by `ImageAttachmentContent` inside the message list now auto-size themselves intelligently according to their aspect ratio. If you wish to limit the maximum vertical height of such images, use `StreamDimens.attachmentsContentImageMaxHeight`.  [#4013](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/pull/4013)

```
binding.messageListView.setMessageItemTransformer { list ->
  list.mapIndexed { i, messageItem ->
        var newMessageItem = messageItem

        if (i < list.lastIndex) {
            val nextMessageItem = list[i + 1]

            if (messageItem is MessageListItem.MessageItem &&
                nextMessageItem is MessageListItem.MessageItem
            ) {
                val thisInstant = messageItem.message.createdAt?.time?.let(Instant::ofEpochMilli)

                    newMessageItem = messageItem.copy(positions = listOf(MessageListItem.Position.BOTTOM))
                } else {
                    newMessageItem =
                        messageItem.copy(positions = messageItem.positions - MessageListItem.Position.BOTTOM)
                }

This default behavior can be customized using `MessageListView::setDeletedMessageListItemPredicate` function. This function takes an instance of `MessageListItemPredicate`. You can pass one of the following objects:
  * `DeletedMessageListItemPredicate.VisibleToEveryone`
  * `DeletedMessageListItemPredicate.NotVisibleToAnyone`
  * or `DeletedMessageListItemPredicate.VisibleToAuthorOnly`
    Alternatively you can pass your custom implementation by implementing the `MessageListItemPredicate` interface if you need to customize it more deeply.

## stream-chat-android-compose
### 🐞 Fixed
- Fixed a bug where we didn't use the `Channel.getDisplayName()` logic for the `MessageListHeader`.
- Fixed a bug where lazy loading for `Channel`s wasn't working consistently

### ⬆️ Improved
- Updated Jetpack Compose to `1.0.1`
- Updated Accompanist libraries to `0.16.1`
- Updated KTX Activity to `1.3.1`
- Exposed functionality for getting the `displayName` of `Channel`s.
- Added updated logic to Link preview attachments, which chooses either the `titleLink` or the `ogUrl` when loading the data, depending on which exists .

### ✅ Added
- Added the `emptyContent` and `loadingContent` parameters to `ChannelList` and `MessageList` components. Now you can customize the UI of those two states.
- Added lots of improvements to Avatars - added a `UserAvatar`, `ChannelAvatar` and an `InitialsAvatar` to load different types of data.
- We now show a matrix of user images in case we're in a group DM.
- We also show initials in case the user doesn't have an image.
- Added a way to customize the leading content in the `ChannelListHeader`.

### ⚠️ Changed
- `ViewModel`s now initialize automatically, so you no longer have to call `start()` on them. This is aimed to improve the consistency between our SDKs.
- Added a `Shape` parameter to `Avatar` to customize the shape.
- The `User` parameter in the `ChannelListHeader` is nullable and used to display the default leading content.

## stream-chat-android-pushprovider-firebase
### ✅ Added
- Create this new artifact. To use Firebase Push Notification you need do the following steps:
  1. Add the artifact to your `build.gradle` file -> `implementation "io.getstream:stream-chat-android-pushprovider-firebase:$streamVersion"`
  2. Add `FirebaseDeviceGenerator` to your `NotificationConfig`
        ```
            val notificationConfig = NotificationConfig(
                [...]
                pushDeviceGenerators = listOf(FirebasePushDeviceGenerator())
                )
        ```


# August 5th, 2021 - 4.15.1
## stream-chat-android-client

## stream-chat-android-compose

- Allowed for better message customization before sending the message.

### ⚠️ Changed
- Moved permissions and queries from the compose sample app `AndroidManifest.xml` to the SDK `AndroidManifest.xml` so users don't have to add permissions themselves.
- Changed the exposed type of the `MessageComposer`'s `onSendMessage` handler. This way people can customize messages before we send them to the API.

### ❌ Removed
- Removed `currentUser` parameter from `DefaultMessageContainer` and some other components that relied on ID comparison to know which message is ours/theirs.
- Removed default background color on `Messages` component, so that users can customize it by passing in a `modifier`.

  - Deprecated `ChatClient.onNewTokenReceived`
  - Changed `ChatNotificationHandler::buildNotification` signature - it now receives `Channel` and `Message` and returns `NotificationCompat.Builder` for better customization
  - Deprecated `ChatNotificationHandler.getSmallIcon`
  - Deprecated `ChatNotificationHandler.getFirebaseMessageIdKey`
  - Deprecated `ChatNotificationHandler.getFirebaseChannelIdKey`
  - Deprecated `ChatNotificationHandler.getFirebaseChannelTypeKey`
  - Changed `ChatNotificationHandler::onChatEvent` - it now doesn't handle events by default and receives `NewMessageEvent` instead of generic `ChatEvent`
- Improved error description provided by `ChatClient::sendImage`, `ChatClient::sendFile`, `ChannelClient::sendImage` and `ChannelClient::sendFile` methods if upload fails.

### ✅ Added
- Added `ChatClient::truncateChannel` and `ChannelClient::truncate` methods to remove messages from a channel.
- Added `DisconnectCause` to `DisconnectedEvent`
- Added method `SocketListener::onDisconnected(cause: DisconnectCause)`
- Added possibility to group notifications:
  - Notifications grouping is disabled by default and can be enabled using `NotificationConfig::shouldGroupNotifications`
  - If enabled, by default notifications are grouped by Channel's cid
  - Notifications grouping can be configured using `ChatNotificationHandler` and `NotificationConfig`
- Added `ChatNotificationHandler::getFirebaseMessaging()` method in place of `ChatNotificationHandler::getFirebaseInstanceId()`.
  It should be used now to fetch Firebase token in the following way: `handler.getFirebaseMessaging()?.token?.addOnCompleteListener {...}`.

## stream-chat-android-ui-components
### 🐞 Fixed
Fixing filter for draft channels. Those channels were not showing in the results, even when the user asked for them. Now this is fixed and the draft channels can be included in the `ChannelListView`.
Fixed bug when for some video attachments activity with media player wasn't shown.

### ✅ Added
- Added `topLeft`, `topRight`, `bottomLeft`, `bottomRight` options to the `streamUiAvatarOnlineIndicatorPosition` attribute of `AvatarView` and corresponding constants to `AvatarView.OnlineIndicatorPosition` enum.

### ⚠️ Changed
- Swipe options of `ChannelListView` component:
  - "Channel more" option is now not shown by default because we are not able to provide generic, default implementation for it.
    If you want to make this option visible, you need to set `app:streamUiChannelOptionsEnabled="true"` explicitly to `io.getstream.chat.android.ui.channel.list.ChannelListView` component.
  - "Channel delete" option has now default implementation. Clicking on the "delete" icon shows AlertDialog asking to confirm Channel deletion operation.

# May 11th, 2021 - 4.10.0
## stream-chat-android-client
### 🐞 Fixed
- Fixed the usage of `ProgressCallback` in `ChannelClient::sendFile` and `ChannelClient::sendImage` methods.

- `notification.channel_truncated`
- `notification.added_to_channel`
- `notification.channel_deleted`
- Added `channel` field to the `NotificationInviteAcceptedEvent` event
- Added `channel` field to the `NotificationInviteRejectedEvent` event

### ⚠️ Changed
- **The client now uses a new serialization implementation by default**, which was [previously](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/releases/tag/4.8.0) available as an opt-in API.
  - This new implementation is more performant and greatly improves type safety in the networking code of the SDK.
  - If you experience any issues after upgrading to this version of the SDK, you can call `useNewSerialization(false)` when building your `ChatClient` to revert to using the old implementation. Note however that we'll be removing the old implementation soon, so please report any issues found.
  - To check if the new implementation is causing any failures in your app, enable error logging on `ChatClient` with the `logLevel` method, and look for the `NEW_SERIALIZATION_ERROR` tag in your logs while using the SDK.
- Made the `user` field in `channel.hidden` and `notification.invite_accepter` events non nullable.
- Updated channels state after `NotificationInviteRejectedEvent` or `NotificationInviteAcceptedEvent` is received

### ❌ Removed
- Removed redundant events which can only be received by using webhooks:
  - `channel.created`
  - `channel.muted`
  - `channel.unmuted`
  - `channel.muted`
  - `channel.unmuted`
- Removed `watcherCount` field from the following events as they are not returned with the server response:
  - `message.deleted`
  - `message.read`
  - `message.updated`
  - `notification.mark_read`
- Removed `user` field from the following events as they are not returned with the server response:
  - `notification.channel_deleted`
  - `notification.channel_truncated`

If you were relying on message.channel it's likely that you were running into bugs.
We recommend using one of these alternatives:

- message.cid if you just need a reference to the channel
- the channel object provided by client.queryChannel(s) if you need the full channel data
- channelController.channelData livedata object provided by the livedata package (automatically updated if channel data changes)

- `MessageInputView#progressCapturedMedia(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data)` renamed into `captureMedia(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data)`
- `binding.messageInput.permissionResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults)` in `onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults) of `ChannelActivity`

## September 28, 2019 - 2.0.1 (stream-chat-android)
- Fix channel list ordering when a channel is added directly from Android
- Better Proguard support

## September 26, 2019 - 2.0.0 (stream-chat-android)
- Simplify random access to channels
- Channel query and watch methods now work the same as they do on all other SDKs

#### Breaking changes:
- `channel.query` does not watch the channel anymore, to retrieve channel state and watch use `channel.watch`
- `client.getChannelByCID` is now private, use one of the `client.channel` methods to get the same (no null checks needed)
