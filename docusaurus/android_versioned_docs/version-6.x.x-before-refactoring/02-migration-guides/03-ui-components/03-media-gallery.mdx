# Media Gallery

Previously, our XML only opened a gallery with attachments of type image. Now, we can open a gallery with images and/or other types of attachments..
The style of the gallery remains the same as before, but its name has changed.
Whenever you were using the "Image Attachment Style" you will need to change it to the "Media Attachment Style."

You can find the docs to customize the gallery [here](../../04-ui/05-utility-components/04-attachment-gallery.mdx).
