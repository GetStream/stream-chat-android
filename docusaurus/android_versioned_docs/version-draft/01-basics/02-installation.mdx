# Installation

All Stream Android libraries are available from MavenCentral, with some of their transitive dependencies hosted on Jitpack. 

Before you add Stream dependencies, update your repositories in the `settings.gradle` file to include these two repositories:

```groovy {5-6}
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Or if you're using an older project setup, add these repositories in your project level `build.gradle` file:

```groovy {4-5}
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Check the [Releases page](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/releases) for the latest version and the changelog.

## Available Artifacts

### Client

To add the low-level Chat client library to your app, open your module's `build.gradle` script and add the following:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-chat-android-client:$stream_version"
}
```

### State

To use the state library in your application, add the following dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-chat-android-state:$stream_version"
}
```

### Offline Support

To use offline support in your application, add the following dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-chat-android-offline:$stream_version"
}
```

This also adds the client library automatically.

### UI Components

To use the [UI Components](../02-ui-components/01-getting-started.mdx) in your application, add the following dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-chat-android-ui-components:$stream_version"
}
```

Adding the UI Components library as a dependency will automatically include the client and offline libraries as well.

### Compose UI Components

To use the [Compose UI Components](../03-compose/01-overview.mdx) instead, add the following dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-chat-android-compose:$stream_version"
}
```

Adding the Compose UI Components library as a dependency will automatically include the client and offline libraries as well.

### Markdown support

We ship an additional artifact for Markdown support which can be used together with the UI Components library:

 ```groovy
 dependencies {
     implementation "stream-chat-android-markdown-transformer:$stream_version"
 }
 ```

 For more information see [UI Components Configuration](../02-ui-components/02-general-customization/02-chatui.mdx#markdown) guide.

### Push Notifications

We ship multiple artifacts to easily integrate Stream Chat with third party push notification providers. See the [Push Notification page](../04-client/06-guides/01-push-notifications/01-overview.mdx) for more details.
