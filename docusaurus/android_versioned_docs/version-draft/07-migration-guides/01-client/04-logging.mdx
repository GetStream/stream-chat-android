# Stream Logger

`StreamLog` was originally a part of [stream-chat-android](https://github.com/getStream/stream-chat-android), but it has been extracted into an [open-source library](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-log) that you can use in your own project without the need to depend on ChatSDK. 

In case you have used `StreamLog` in your project previously, you can now use the open-source library instead.

## Introduction
You can add the dependency to your project by using the following code:
```groovy {2}
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-log:$stream_log_version"
}
```

`StreamLog` itself represents a logging manager (entry point) that allows you to install a logger and configure the output.

```kotlin
// Install a logger
StreamLog.installLogger(logger = KotlinLogger())

// Configure the output.
// The log will be printed to the console only if the priority is DEBUG and the tag is TAG_NAME
StreamLog.setValidator { priority, tag ->
    priority.level >= Priority.DEBUG.level && tag == "TAG_NAME"
}
```

Now you can use the logger to print the log:
```kotlin
streamLog(priority = Priority.INFO, tag = "TAG_NAME") { "This is a log message 1" }
StreamLog.d(tag = "TAG_NAME") { "This is a log message 2" }
```

That will result in the following output:
```
2023-06-21 16:43:50'345 (main:1) [I/TAG_NAME]: This is a log message 1
2023-06-21 16:43:50'345 (main:1) [D/TAG_NAME]: This is a log message 2
```

Additionally, you can use the tagged logger per class usage, like in example below:
```kotlin
class SomeClass {
    private val logger = StreamLog.getLogger(tag = "SomeClass")
    // OR you can use the lazy initialization
    private val logger by taggedLogger(tag = "SomeClass")
    
    fun someFunction() {
        logger.d { "This is a log message" }
    }
}
```
:::note
If you don't specify the `tag` for `taggedLogger`, the class name will be used as a tag.

## Android Logging

If you have used other implementations of `StreamLogger` such as `AndroidStreamLogger`.
It has be extracted to the separate library as well.

Here is the way it can be included into your project:
```groovy {2}
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-log-android:$stream_log_version"
}
```

### Initialization
`AndroidStreamLogger` is a logger implementation which utilizes `Logcat` for the logs printing.
It can be installed as shown in the snippet below.
```kotlin
class App : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        // install AndroidStreamLogger.
        AndroidStreamLogger.installOnDebuggableApp(this)

        // change the log validator as your taste.
        StreamLog.setValidator { priority, tag -> 
            priority.level >= Priority.VERBOSE.level && tag == "TAG_NAME" 
        }
    }
}
```
