# Getting Started

Let's see how you can get started with the Android Chat SDK after adding the required [dependencies](./03-dependencies.mdx). This page shows you how to initialize the SDK in your app.

:::note
If you're looking for a complete, step-by-step guide that includes setting up an Android project from scratch, try our [Android In-App Messaging Tutorial](https://getstream.io/tutorials/android-chat/) or the [Jetpack Compose Android In-App Messaging Tutorial](https://getstream.io/chat/compose/tutorial/) in case you want to use our Compose powered Chat SDK.

### Setting up the ChatClient

Your first step is initializing the `ChatClient`, which is the main entry point for all operations in the library. `ChatClient` is a singleton: you'll create it once and re-use it across your application.

The best practice is to initialize `ChatClient` in the `Application` class:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
class App : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        val chatClient = ChatClient.Builder("apiKey", applicationContext).build()
    }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
class App extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        ChatClient chatClient = new ChatClient.Builder("apiKey", getApplicationContext()).build();
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The _Builder_ for `ChatClient` exposes configuration options for features such as [Logging](./06-logging.mdx).

:::note
To generate an API key, you can sign up for a [free 30-day trial](https://getstream.io/chat/trial/). You can then access your API key in the [Dashboard](https://getstream.io/dashboard).
:::

If you create the `ChatClient` instance following the pattern shown in the previous example, you will be able to access that instance from any part of your application using the `instance()` method:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        val chatClient = ChatClient.instance() // Returns the singleton instance
    }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        ChatClient chatClient = ChatClient.instance();  // Returns the singleton instance
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Adding the Offline Plugin

If you want to have offline support or **use our UI Components**, you'll need to initialize the `OfflinePlugin` class and add it to the `ChatClient.Builder`. You can skip this step if you're only using the low-level client.

The initialization should be done using `StreamOfflinePluginFactory`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val offlinePluginFactory = StreamOfflinePluginFactory(
    config = Config(
        // Enables background sync which syncs user actions performed while offline.
        backgroundSyncEnabled = true,
        // Enables the ability to receive information about user activity such as last active date and if they are online right now.
        userPresence = true,
        // Enables using the database as an internal caching mechanism.
        persistenceEnabled = true,
        // An enumeration of various network types used as a constraint inside upload attachments worker.
        uploadAttachmentsNetworkType = UploadAttachmentsNetworkType.NOT_ROAMING,
    ),
    appContext = context,
)

ChatClient.Builder(apiKey, context).withPlugin(offlinePluginFactory).build()
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
// Enables background sync which syncs user actions performed while offline.
boolean backgroundSyncEnabled = true;
// Enables the ability to receive information about user activity such as last active date and if they are online right now.
boolean userPresence = true;
// Enables using the database as an internal caching mechanism.
boolean persistenceEnabled = true;
// An enumeration of various network types used as a constraint inside upload attachments worker.
UploadAttachmentsNetworkType uploadAttachmentsNetworkType = UploadAttachmentsNetworkType.NOT_ROAMING;
// Whether the SDK will use a new sequential event handling mechanism.
boolean useSequentialEventHandler = false;

StreamOfflinePluginFactory offlinePluginFactory = new StreamOfflinePluginFactory(new Config(backgroundSyncEnabled, userPresence, persistenceEnabled, uploadAttachmentsNetworkType, useSequentialEventHandler), context);
new ChatClient.Builder("apiKey", context).withPlugin(offlinePluginFactory).build();
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

For more information on working with `OfflinePlugin`, see [Offline Support](../02-client/06-guides/06-offline-support.mdx)

### Connecting a User

The next step is to connect the user. This requires a valid Stream Chat token. As you must use your `API_SECRET` to create this token, it is unsafe to generate this token outside of a secure server.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val user = User(
    id = "bender",
    name = "Bender",
    image = "https://bit.ly/321RmWb",
)

// Connect the user only if they aren't already connected
if (ChatClient.instance().getCurrentUser() == null) {

    ChatClient.instance().connectUser(user = user, token = "userToken") // Replace with a real token
        .enqueue { result ->
            when (result) {
                is Result.Success -> {
                    // Handle success
                }
                is Result.Failure -> {
                    // Handler error
                }
            }
        }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
User user = new User();
user.setId("bender");
user.setName("Bender");
user.setImage("https://bit.ly/321RmWb");

// Connect the user only if they aren't already connected
if (ChatClient.instance().getCurrentUser() == null) {

    ChatClient.instance().connectUser(user, "userToken")  // Replace with a real token
            .enqueue((result) -> {
                if (result.isSuccess()) {
                    // Handle success
                } else {
                    // Handle error
                }
            });
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
To learn more about how to create a token and different user types, see [Tokens & Authentication](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/android/tokens_and_authentication/?language=kotlin).
:::

If the `connectUser()` call was successful, you are now ready to use the SDK. ðŸŽ‰

:::warning
You shouldn't call `connectUser` if the user is already set. You can use `ChatClient.instance().getCurrentUser()` to verify if the user is already connected.
:::

The methods of the `ChatClient` class allow you to create channels, send messages, add reactions, and perform many more low-level operations. You can also use the SDK's pre-built UI Components that will perform data fetching and sending for you, as described below.

### Adding UI Components

There are two UI Component implementations available: one built on regular, XML based Android Views, and another built from the ground up in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

Take a look at the Overview pages of the implementations to get started with them:
- [XML based UI Components](../03-ui/01-overview.mdx)
- [Jetpack Compose UI Components](../04-compose/01-overview.mdx)
