# ChannelListHeader

The `ChannelListHeader` component allows you to display a header for the channels screen. It sets up the following:

* **User avatar**: Shows the current user image.
* **Header title**: A component that shows the title of the header, or a loading view if there's no network available.
* **Action button**: A customizable trailing action shown at the end of the header, exposed as a parameter.

Let's see how to use the header.

## Usage

To use the `ChannelListHeader`, you can add it to your UI, within `setContent()`:

```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        
    setContent {
        ChatTheme {
            ChannelListHeader(
                modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
                currentUser = user,
                title = "My Awesome App"
            )
        }
    }
}
```

This will produce the UI below:

:::note 
The `ChannelListHeader` can be used without any parameters, but we advise that you pass in the title of your app, the current user, as well as the action handlers.

Next, let's see how to handle actions in the header.

## Handling Actions

The `ChannelListHeader` exposes two main actions you can override and handle yourself, as per the signature:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ChannelListHeader(
    ..., // State
    onAvatarClick: (User?) -> Unit = {},
    onHeaderActionClick: () -> Unit = {}
)
```

* `onAvatarClick`: Handler when the user taps on their own avatar.
* `onHeaderActionClick`: Handler when the user taps on the trailing action. This is only used if you don't override the `trailingContent` parameter, which defines the UI for the trailing icon.

:::note
The `trailingContent` parameter uses the `onHeaderActionClick` parameter for the default header action. If you want to keep the same UI but override the behavior, you need to change `onHeaderActionClick`. Otherwise, skip over to [Customization](#customization) to learn how to customize the action UI.
:::

To override the actions, you can use the following approach:

```kotlin
ChannelListHeader(
    ..., // State
    onHeaderActionClick = {}, // Default header action
    onAvatarClick = {} // Avatar click action
)
```

These two parameters let you gain more control over the behavior of the `ChannelListHeader`. Let's see how to customize the appearance next.

## Customization

In terms of UI customization, the `ChannelListHeader` exposes the following properties:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ChannelListHeader(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    title: String = "",
    currentUser: User? = null,
    connectionState = ConnectionState.CONNECTED,
    color: Color = ChatTheme.colors.barsBackground,
    shape: Shape = ChatTheme.shapes.header,
    elevation: Dp = ChatTheme.dimens.headerElevation,
    leadingContent: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit = { ... },
    centerContent: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit = { ... },
    trailingContent: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit = { ... },
    ... // Action handlers
)
```

* `modifier`: Modifier for the root component. You can use it to add padding or change the dimensions and such, however attributes such as color, shape and elevation have their own parameters.
* `title`: The text to show when you're connected to the Internet.
* `currentUser`: The state of the current user, for displaying the `Avatar`.
* `connectionState`: The state of WebSocket connection, used to switch between the title and the `NetworkLoadingView`.
* `color`: The color of the header.
* `shape`: The shape of the header.
* `elevation`: The elevation of the header.
* `leadingContent`: Represents the content at the beginning of the header. By default shows the channel avatar that you can override or change the behavior of `onAvatarClick`.
* `centerContent`: Represents the core and center part of the header. By default shows the title and the network status that you can override.
* `trailingContent`: Represents the content at the end of the header. By default shows a button that you can override or change the behavior of `trailingContent`.

Here's an example of customizing the UI of the header:

```kotlin
ChannelListHeader(
    // Customizing the appearance
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
    currentUser = user,
    title = "My Chat App",
    connectionState = ConnectionState.CONNECTED,
    trailingContent = { // Customizing the trailing action
        Icon(
            modifier = Modifier.clickable {
                // Click handler for the custom action
            },
            imageVector = Icons.Default.Add,
            contentDescription = "Add",
            tint = ChatTheme.colors.textHighEmphasis
        )
    }
)
```

By passing in various pieces of data, you control which image is loaded for the `Avatar`, what title is shown, if you need to show the `NetworkLoadingView` or not and finally, what action to show at the end of the header. 

By overriding the `trailingContent` parameter, you replace the default action UI with your custom UI, and by adding a `clickable {}` modifier, you can add click actions on the custom component. This allows you to customize both the UI and behavior.
 
The snippet above will produce the following UI.

<!-- TODO WIP PAGE You can also choose to build a completely custom header and integrate it with the rest of our components. To learn how to do that, read our Building Custom Screens (../07-guides/05-building-custom-screens.mdx) guide. -->
