## Querying Regular Users
The `ChatClient::queryUsers` method allows you to search for users and see if they are online/offline. The example below shows how you can retrieve the details for 3 users in one API call:

```kotlin
// Search for users with id "john", "jack", or "jessie" 
val request = QueryUsersRequest( 
    filter = Filters.`in`("id", listOf("john", "jack", "jessie")), 
    offset = 0, 
    limit = 3, 
) 
 
client.queryUsers(request).enqueue { result -> 
    if (result.isSuccess) { 
        val users: List<User> = result.data() 
    } else { 
        // Handle result.error() 
    } 
}
```

## Querying banned users
Another option is to query for banned users. This can be done with the following code snippet:

```kotlin
val request = QueryUsersRequest( 
    filter = Filters.eq("banned", true), 
    offset = 0, 
    limit = 10, 
) 
 
client.queryUsers(request).enqueue { /* ... */ }
```

Please be aware that this query will return users banned across the entire app, not at a channel level.

You can filter and sort on the custom fields you've set for your user, the user id, and when the user was last active.

The options for the `queryUsers` method are presence, limit, and offset. If presence is `true` this makes sure you receive the `user.presence.changed` event when a user goes online or offline.

## Querying users by search term
You can autocomplete the results of your user query by username and/or ID.

If you want to return all users whose username includes 'ro', you could do so with the following:
```kotlin
val request = QueryUsersRequest( 
    filter = Filters.autocomplete("name", "ro"), 
    offset = 0, 
    limit = 10, 
) 
client.queryUsers(request).enqueue { /* ... */ }
```

This would return an array of any matching users, such as:

```kotlin
[ 
    { 
        "id": "userID", 
        "name": "Curiosity Rover" 
    }, 
    { 
        "id": "userID2", 
        "name": "Roxy" 
    }, 
    { 
        "id": "userID3", 
        "name": "Roxanne" 
    } 
]
```
