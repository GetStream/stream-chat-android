# Getting Started

First things first, you have to initialize the `ChatClient` in your application. 
This is the main entry point for all the chat functionalities. 
Typically you would initialize the `ChatClient` in your `Application` class.

```kotlin
ChatClient.Builder("YOUR_API_KEY", context)
    // Set other configurations
    .build()

// Static reference to initialised client
val client = ChatClient.instance()
```

## Connecting a User

Once you have the `ChatClient` initialised, you can connect a user to the chat.

Let's say you have a `User` model:    
```kotlin
val user = User(
    id = "bender",
    name = "Bender",
    image = "https://bit.ly/321RmWb",
)
```

Then you may can call the `connectUser` method with either a JWT token or a `TokenProvider` to connect the user to the chat.

Here is an example of how to connect a user to the chat with a JWT token:
```kotlin
val token = "CHAT_USER_TOKEN"
client.connectUser(user, token).enqueue { result ->
    when (result) {
        is Result.Success -> {
            // Logged in
            val loggedInUser: User = result.value.user
            val connectionId: String = result.value.connectionId
        }
        is Result.Failure -> {
            // Handle error
            val error = result.value

        }
    }
}
```

Here is an example of how to connect a user to the chat with a `TokenProvider`:
```kotlin
val tokenProvider = object : TokenProvider {
    // Make a request to your backend to generate a valid token for the user
    override fun loadToken(): String = yourTokenService.getToken(user)
}
client.connectUser(user, tokenProvider).enqueue { /* ... */ }
```

## Lifecycle Management

Most commonly, you would want to call `ChatClient#connectUser` when the user logs in and `ChatClient#disconnect` when the user logs out.

:::note
Please take into account that the `ChatClient` cannot survive a process death.
When the app process gets killed with the logged-in user, you will need to call `ChatClient#connectUser` again to re-establish the connection.
:::

To handle those scenarios, you could define some `UserRepository` in your application that would be responsible for storing the logged-in user until the user logs out.

```kotlin
interface UserRepository {
    fun getCurrentUser(): User?
    fun setCurrentUser(user: User)
    fun clearCurrentUser()
}
```

:::note
Please note that the `UserRepository` is just an example.
You can name it whatever you want and use any storage mechanism for the implementation (e.g. `SharedPreferences`, `Room`, etc.).
The main idea is to have a storage which will be able to provide the logged-in user when the app restarts after a process death.
:::

Then when the user logs in, you would call `ChatClient#connectUser` and store the user in the `UserRepository`.

```kotlin
val user = User(/* ... */)
client.connectUser(user, tokenProvider).enqueue { result ->
    if (result is Result.Success) {
        userRepository.setCurrentUser(result.value.user)
    } else if (result is Result.Failure) {
        // Handle error
    }
}
```

When the user logs out, you would call `ChatClient#disconnect` and clear the user from the `UserRepository`.
```kotlin
client.disconnect().enqueue { result ->
    userRepository.clearCurrentUser()
    // Handle result
}
```

Please note that you should also call `ChatClient#connectUser` when the Application restarts after a process death and there is a logged-in user in the `UserRepository`.
```kotlin
val user = userRepository.getCurrentUser()
if (user != null) {
    client.connectUser(user, tokenProvider).enqueue { /* ... */ }
}
```
