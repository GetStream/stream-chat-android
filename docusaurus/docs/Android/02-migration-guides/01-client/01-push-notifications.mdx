# Push Notifications

Artifacts related with Push Notifications have been extracted from the main repository. You can find them on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/getstream/stream-android-push)

## Updated methods
We have changed/removed some methods related with our Push Notification implementation, if you are using any of them, follow the next steps:
- `ChatClient.setDevice()`: This method is not needed at all, our SDK already take care of this logic whenever you configure Push Notifications into our `ChatClient`.
- `ChatClient.dismissChannelNotifications()`: This static method has been moved into `ChatClient` class, so if you were using it, you will need to obtain your `ChatClient` instance before to call it.
- `NotificationHandlerFactory.createNotificationHandler()`: The signature of this factory method has been updated. The lambda that is executed to create the intent that will handle the Push Notification is receiving now the whole `Message`/`Channel` entity.
```kotlin {3-10}
val notificationHandler = NotificationHandlerFactory.createNotificationHandler(
    context = context,
    newMessageIntent = {
        message: Message,
        channel: Channel,
         ->
        // Return the intent you want to be triggered when the notification is clicked
        val intent: Intent = [....]
        intent
    }
)
```

## Firebase
If you were using our Firebase Implementation and want to keep it, you only need to switch the dependency in your `build.gradle` file, and update the imports where the old classes are used.
```groovy {2}
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-android-push-firebase:$stream_android_push_version"
}
```

The constructor of `FirebasePushDeviceGenerator` has been updated, now it requires a provider name.
```kotlin {2}
val firebasePushDeviceGenerator = FirebasePushDeviceGenerator(
    providerName = "your_provider_name"
)
```

## Huawei
If you were using our Huawei Implementation and want to keep it, you only need to switch the dependency in your `build.gradle` file, and update the imports where the old classes are used.
```groovy {2}
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-android-push-huawei:$stream_android_push_version"
}
```

The constructor of `HuaweiPushDeviceGenerator` has been updated, now it requires a provider name.
```kotlin {4}
val huaweiPushDeviceGenerator = HuaweiPushDeviceGenerator(
    context = context,
    appId = ApplicationConfigurator.HUAWEI_APP_ID,
    providerName = "your_provider_name",
)
```

## Xiaomi
If you were using our Xiaomi Implementation and want to keep it, you only need to switch the dependency in your `build.gradle` file, and update the imports where the old classes are used.
```groovy {2}
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-android-push-xiaomi:$stream_android_push_version"
}
```

The constructor of `XiaomiPushDeviceGenerator` has been updated, now it requires a provider name.
```kotlin {5}
val xiaomiPushDeviceGenerator = XiaomiPushDeviceGenerator(
    context = context,
    appId = ApplicationConfigurator.XIAOMI_APP_ID,
    appKey = ApplicationConfigurator.XIAOMI_APP_KEY,
    providerName = "your_provider_name",
)
```
