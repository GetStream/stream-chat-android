# Offline and State Plugins

**Stream Android Chat SDK v6** brings several enhancements and changes to the plugin architecture. 
In this migration guide, we'll walk you through the key modifications and provide instructions on how to adapt your existing codebase to the new version.

## Architecture Changes

To enhance architectural flexibility, the `StreamStatePluginFactory` has been separated from the `StreamOfflinePluginFactory`. 
It now functions as an independent plugin factory, allowing developers to decouple state and persistence functionalities and customize their chat applications with greater precision.

### Offline Plugin

The first notable change is the removal of the `io.getstream.chat.android.offline.plugin.configuration.Config` class. 
This class has been deleted since `StreamOfflinePluginFactory` no longer requires a `Config` parameter. 
Instead, the configuration for the offline functionality can now be controlled by including or excluding the `StreamOfflinePluginFactory` in the list of `plugins` when configuring your `ChatClient`.

In addition, parameters that were previously included in the `Config` have been removed from the **SDK** as well:
- The `useSequentialEventHandler` flag has been removed from the Stream Android Chat SDK as the sequential event handling mechanism is now the sole option available. This change ensures a streamlined event processing flow, resulting in a more seamless and robust chat experience within your applications.
- The `persistenceEnabled` flag has been removed since the persistence functionality is now controlled by including or excluding the `StreamOfflinePluginFactory` in the `ChatClient` plugins.

Moreover, the `uploadAttachmentsNetworkType` parameter has been moved from the `Config` to the `ChatClient`.
Furthermore, the `UploadAttachmentsNetworkType` class has been transferred from `stream-chat-android-state` to `stream-chat-android-core`. 
Along with this migration, the package of the `UploadAttachmentsNetworkType` class has been changed from `io.getstream.chat.android.offline.model.message.attachments` to `io.getstream.chat.android.models`.

:::note
The purpose of the `Offline plugin` was narrowed down to providing offline support (persistence layer) for the chat functionality.

Here is how `StreamOfflinePluginFactory` is now initialized:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val offlinePluginFactory = StreamOfflinePluginFactory(context)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
StreamOfflinePluginFactory offlinePluginFactory = new StreamOfflinePluginFactory(context);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here is where `uploadAttachmentsNetworkType` parameter is passed now:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
import io.getstream.chat.android.models.UploadAttachmentsNetworkType

//...

ChatClient.Builder(apiKey, context)
    // uploadAttachmentsNetworkType is passed here.
    .uploadAttachmentsNetworkType(UploadAttachmentsNetworkType.NOT_ROAMING)
    .build()
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
import io.getstream.chat.android.models.UploadAttachmentsNetworkType;

//...

new ChatClient.Builder(apiKey, context)
        // uploadAttachmentsNetworkType is passed here.
        .uploadAttachmentsNetworkType(UploadAttachmentsNetworkType.NOT_ROAMING)
        .build();
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### State Plugin

The `StreamStatePluginFactory` has been separated from the `StreamOfflinePluginFactory` and now exists as a distinct, independent plugin factory. 
This deliberate decision allows for better modularity and independent control over each plugin's functionalities.

Some flags, such as `backgroundSyncEnabled` and `userPresence` of the offline plugin's `Config` have been migrated to `StatePluginConfig`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
import io.getstream.chat.android.state.plugin.config.StatePluginConfig

//...

StatePluginConfig(
    // Enables the background sync which is performed to sync user actions done without the Internet connection.
    backgroundSyncEnabled = true,
    // Enables the ability to receive information about user activity such as last active date and if they are online right now.
    userPresence = true,
)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
import io.getstream.chat.android.state.plugin.config.StatePluginConfig;

//...

// Enable background sync which syncs user actions performed while offline
boolean backgroundSyncEnabled = true;
// Enable tracking online states for users
boolean userPresence = true;

StreamStatePluginFactory statePluginFactory = new StreamStatePluginFactory(
        new StatePluginConfig(
                backgroundSyncEnabled,
                userPresence
        ),
        context
);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Let's summarize all the initialization changes in the one place
Here is the way the `ChatClient` initialization looked in **v5**:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val offlinePluginFactory = StreamOfflinePluginFactory(
    config = Config(
        // Enables the background sync which is performed to sync user actions done without the Internet connection.
        backgroundSyncEnabled = true,
        // Enables the ability to receive information about user activity such as last active date and if they are online right now.
        userPresence = true,
        // Enables using the database as an internal caching mechanism.
        persistenceEnabled = true,
        // An enumeration of various network types used as a constraint inside upload attachments worker.
        uploadAttachmentsNetworkType = UploadAttachmentsNetworkType.NOT_ROAMING,
        // Whether the SDK will use a new sequential event handling mechanism.
        useSequentialEventHandler = false,
    ),
    appContext = context,
)

ChatClient.Builder(apiKey, context)
    .withPlugin(offlinePluginFactory)
    .build()
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
// Enables background sync which is performed to sync user actions done while offline.
boolean backgroundSyncEnabled = true;
// Enables the ability to receive information about user activity such as last active date and if they are online right now.
boolean userPresence = true;
// Enables using the database as an internal caching mechanism.
boolean persistenceEnabled = true;
// An enumeration of various network types used as a constraint inside upload attachments worker.
UploadAttachmentsNetworkType uploadAttachmentsNetworkType = UploadAttachmentsNetworkType.NOT_ROAMING;
// Whether the SDK will use a new sequential event handling mechanism.
boolean useSequentialEventHandler = true;

StreamOfflinePluginFactory offlinePluginFactory = new StreamOfflinePluginFactory(
        new Config(
                backgroundSyncEnabled, 
                userPresence, 
                persistenceEnabled, 
                uploadAttachmentsNetworkType, 
                useSequentialEventHandler
        ), context);
new ChatClient.Builder(apiKey, context)
        .withPlugin(offlinePluginFactory)
        .build();
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here is the way the `ChatClient` initialization looks in **v6**:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val statePluginFactory = StreamStatePluginFactory(
    appContext = context,
    config = StatePluginConfig(

        backgroundSyncEnabled = true,
        // Enables the ability to receive information about user activity such as last active date and if they are online right now.
        userPresence = true,
    ),
)

val offlinePluginFactory = StreamOfflinePluginFactory(context)

ChatClient.Builder(apiKey, context)
    .withPlugins(statePluginFactory, offlinePluginFactory)
    .uploadAttachmentsNetworkType(
        // An enumeration of various network types used as a constraint inside upload attachments worker.
        UploadAttachmentsNetworkType.NOT_ROAMING
    )
    .build()
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
// Enable background sync which syncs user actions performed while offline
boolean backgroundSyncEnabled = true;
// Enable tracking online states for users
boolean userPresence = true;

StreamStatePluginFactory statePluginFactory = new StreamStatePluginFactory(
        new StatePluginConfig(
                backgroundSyncEnabled,
                userPresence
        ),
        context
);

StreamOfflinePluginFactory offlinePluginFactory = new StreamOfflinePluginFactory(context);

new ChatClient.Builder(apiKey, context)
        .uploadAttachmentsNetworkType(
                // An enumeration of various network types used as a constraint inside upload attachments worker.
                UploadAttachmentsNetworkType.NOT_ROAMING
        )
        .withPlugins(statePluginFactory, offlinePluginFactory)
        .build();
```

</TabItem>
