# Media Gallery

Previously, our XML only opened a gallery with attachments of type image. Now, we can open a gallery with image and/or type of attachment.
The style of the gallery is the same as the previous one but its name is different.
Whenever you were using any "Image Attachment Style" you will need to change it to "Media Attachment Style."

You can find the docs to customize the gallery [here](../../04-ui/05-utility-components/04-attachment-gallery.mdx).
