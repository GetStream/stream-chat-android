# ChatDomain Migration

**v5.0.0** release brings a big change to the offline support library - it replaces `ChatDomain` with a new, easy-to-use `OfflinePlugin`.
You can read more about the motivation behind the effort and featured changes in the [announcement blog post](https://getstream.io/blog/).  <!--TODO: Replace with a real link -->

The guide will help you with migrating from version `4.X.X` to `5.X.X`.

### Initialization

Compared to `ChatDomain`, which was a standalone singleton with its own API, `OfflinePlugin` is a plugin that should be provided to the `ChatClient.Builder`:

```kotlin
val offlinePluginFactory = StreamOfflinePluginFactory(
    config = Config(
        backgroundSyncEnabled = true,
        userPresence = true,
        persistenceEnabled = true,
        uploadAttachmentsNetworkType = UploadAttachmentsNetworkType.NOT_ROAMING,
    ),
    appContext = context,
)

ChatClient.Builder(apiKey, context).withPlugin(offlinePluginFactory).build()
```

From this point onward, the caching mechanism will be enabled and you'll have access to state objects.

You can read more about the initialization process in [Getting Started](../../01-basics/03-getting-started.mdx#adding-an-offline-plugin) page.

### Requesting Data

`ChatDomain` mirrored some of the `ChatClient` API while adding offline support. For example, if you wanted to send a message with offline support, you were supposed to call:

```kotlin
val message = Message(cid = cid, text = "New message")

chatDomain.sendMessage(message).enqueue { result ->
    if (result.isSuccess) {
        // Handle success
    } else {
        // Handler error
    }
}
```

In the new approach, all the operations should be performed using the `ChatClient` so you don't need to bother yourself whether to use `ChatDomain` or `ChatClient`.
You can use the snippet below to send a message using the new approach:

```kotlin
val message = Message(cid = cid, text = messageText)

chatClient.channel(cid).sendMessage(message).enqueue { result ->
    if (result.isSuccess) {
        // Handle success
    } else {
        // Handle error
    }
}
```

:::note
`chatClient.channel(cid)` returns a `ChannelClient` that uses `ChatClient` under the hood and simplifies performing actions in particular channel.
:::

The approach mentioned above can be applied to all API-call-related `ChatDomain` methods.

### Observing the State

We've renamed the objects used to obtain a state:

- `QueryChannelsController` was replaced by [`QueryChannelsState`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/blob/main/stream-chat-android-offline/src/main/java/io/getstream/chat/android/offline/plugin/state/querychannels/QueryChannelsState.kt) .
- `ChannelController` was replaced by [`ChannelState`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/blob/main/stream-chat-android-offline/src/main/java/io/getstream/chat/android/offline/plugin/state/channel/ChannelState.kt).
- `ThreadController` was replaced by [`ThreadState`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/blob/main/stream-chat-android-offline/src/main/java/io/getstream/chat/android/offline/plugin/state/channel/thread/ThreadState.kt).
- Global state available through `ChatDomain` object can be now obtained from [`GlobalState`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/blob/main/stream-chat-android-offline/src/main/java/io/getstream/chat/android/offline/plugin/state/global/GlobalState.kt) object.

You can access the objects mentioned above like this:

```kotlin
// Returns QueryChannelsState object based on filter and sort used to query channels
val queryChannelsState = chatClient.state.queryChannels(filter = filter, sort = sort)

// Returns ChannelState object for a given channel
val channelState = chatClient.state.channel(channelType = "messaging", channelId = "sampleId")

// Returns ThreadState object for a thread associated with a given parentMessageId
val threadState = chatClient.state.thread(messageId = "parentMessageId")

// Gives you access to GlobalState object
val globalState = chatClient.globalState
```

In addition to that, the offline library provides a bunch of extension methods that can be used to obtain the state after performing a particular API call:

```kotlin
// Old approach - returns ChannelController object and performs watchChannel request
ChatDomain.instance().watchChannel(cid = "messaging:sampleId", messageLimit = 30).enqueue { result ->
    if (result.isSuccess) {
        val channelController = result.data()
    } else {
        // Handle error
    }
}

// New approach - returns ChannelState object and performs watchChannel request
val channelState = chatClient.watchChannelAsState(cid = "messaging:sampleId", messageLimit = 30, coroutineScope = scope)
```

You can read more in the [Offline Support](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/android/client/guides/offline-support/) documentation.

### Other changes

You might notice that some of the method names have changed. For example, `editMessage` was replaced with `updateMessage`:

```kotlin
// Old approach
val messageToUpdate = Message(text = "Updated text")
ChatDomain.instance().editMessage(messageToUpdate).enqueue { result ->
    if (result.isSuccess) {
        // Handle success
    } else {
        // Handle error
    }
}

// New approach
val messageToUpdate = Message(text = "Updated text")
ChatClient.instance().updateMessage(messageToUpdate).enqueue { result ->
    if (result.isSuccess) {
        // Handle success
    } else {
        // Handle error
    }
}
```

The same applies to the method's parameters as some of them were changed.
[Here](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/blob/main/stream-chat-android-client/src/main/java/io/getstream/chat/android/client/ChatClient.kt) you can find the list of available methods.

Last, but not least, we've reorganized the offline library package structure to better match the current implementation.
This shouldn't affect you much because most of the classes are brand new, but you can spot that some of the remaining public classes were moved.
For example, `io.getstream.chat.android.offline.querychannels.ChatEventHandler` was moved to `io.getstream.chat.android.offline.event.handler.chat.ChatEventHandler`.

We strongly recommend to remove imports that cannot be resolved and reimport such classes again.
