# Working with Offline Support

When using the offline library, you first have to build a `ChatDomain` instance as described on the [Getting Started](../../01-basics/03-getting-started.mdx#creating-a-chatdomain) page.

`ChatDomain` is a singleton, just like `ChatClient`. This means that you'll always have just one instance of it in your application. After building it, you can access it with the `instance` method:

```kotlin
val chatDomain = ChatDomain.instance()
```

`ChatDomain` is user specific, so you'll want to disconnect your user and create a new `ChatClient` and `ChatDomain` when the user in your app changes. You can do this using `ChatClient`, which will also disconnect `ChatDomain` automatically:

```kotlin
ChatClient.instance().disconnect()
```

### Flows or LiveData

There are two different `ChatDomain` interfaces available in the offline SDK, in different packages:

- `*.offline.ChatDomain`: Exposes its state as `StateFlow` objects you can collect. You can use this if you're using Kotlin coroutines in your app. 
- `*.livedata.ChatDomain`: Exposes state as `LiveData` objects. Use this if you're writing Java code or prefer LiveData to Flows.

:::note
Make sure you build the same version of `ChatDomain` that you're using in your code elsewhere, otherwise it might not be initialized.
:::

If you want to use both Flows and LiveData, only initialize the LiveData-based `ChatDomain`, as that will also initialize the Flow-based one internally.

### Retry Policy

By default, the retry policy for the `ChatDomain` is set to retry three times and wait `attempt * 1000` milliseconds between attempts. It will also retry when the connection recovers. You can set your own `RetryPolicy` like this:

```kotlin
chatDomain.retryPolicy = object : RetryPolicy {
    override fun shouldRetry(client: ChatClient, attempt: Int, error: ChatError): Boolean {
        return attempt < 3
    }

    override fun retryTimeout(client: ChatClient, attempt: Int, error: ChatError): Int {
        return 1000 * attempt
    }
}
```

## Operations

You can use `ChatDomain` to perform many of the same operations as `ChatClient`. If you use `ChatDomain`, these calls will have offline support, including optimistic UI updates and auto-retries.

For example, you can send a message using `ChatDomain`:

```kotlin
val message = Message(text = "Hello world")
chatDomain.sendMessage(message)
    .enqueue { result ->
        if (result.isSuccess) {
            val message = result.data()
        }
    }
```

The operations on `ChatDomain` return [Call objects](../../01-basics/04-core-concepts.mdx#calls).

Some other basic functions available on `ChatDomain`:

- createChannel()
- sendMessage()
- editMessage()
- deleteMessage()
- sendReaction()
- deleteReaction()
- keystroke()
- stopTyping()
- markRead()

:::note
See the [API documentation for `ChatDomain`](https://getstream.github.io/stream-chat-android/stream-chat-android-offline/stream-chat-android-offline/io.getstream.chat.android.offline/-chat-domain/index.html) for the full list of available features and more info about them.

Let's see how some of the most common operations work.

### Watching a Channel

The following example shows how to get the messages, reads and typing information for a channel:

```kotlin
chatDomain.watchChannel(cid = "messaging:123", messageLimit = 0) 
    .enqueue { result -> 
        if (result.isSuccess) { 
            val channelController = result.data() 
 
            // StateFlow / LiveData objects to observe 
            channelController.messages 
            channelController.reads 
            channelController.typing 
        } 
    }
```

You can load more messages for a channel like this:

```kotlin
chatDomain.loadOlderMessages("messaging:123", 10)
    .enqueue { result ->
        if (result.isSuccess) {
            val channel: Channel = result.data()
        }
    }
```

### Querying Channels

Another common operation for chat is showing a list of channels. You can query channels with `ChatDomain` like this:

```kotlin
val members = listOf("thierry")
val filter = Filters.and(
    Filters.eq("type", "messaging"),
    Filters.`in`("members", members),
)
val sort = QuerySort<Channel>()

chatDomain.queryChannels(filter, sort)
    .enqueue { result ->
        if (result.isSuccess) {
            val queryChannelsController = result.data()

            // StateFlow / LiveData objects to observe 
            queryChannelsController.channels
            queryChannelsController.loading
            queryChannelsController.endOfChannels
        }
    }
```

Then you can load more channels for a particular query:

```kotlin
chatDomain.queryChannelsLoadMore(filter, sort).enqueue { /* ... */ }
```

If successful, this call will update the list of channels that you're observing using the controller from the original query call.

### Querying Threads

Here's how you can retrieve the messages for a thread:

```kotlin
chatDomain.getThread(cid, parentId)
    .enqueue { result ->
        if (result.isSuccess) {
            val threadController = result.data()

            // StateFlow / LiveData objects to observe 
            threadController.messages
            threadController.loadingOlderMessages
            threadController.endOfOlderMessages
        }
    }
```

Then, you can load messages in the thread like this:

```kotlin
chatDomain.threadLoadMore(cid, parentId, messageLimit)
    .enqueue { result ->
        if (result.isSuccess) {
            val messages: List<Message> = result.data()
        }
    }
```

### Unread Counts

`ChatDomain` provides two different counts for a user. Here's how to retrieve them:

```kotlin
// StateFlow / LiveData objects to observe 
val totalUnreadCount = chatDomain.totalUnreadCount
val unreadChannelCount = chatDomain.channelUnreadCount
```

- `totalUnreadCount` is the unread message count for the current user across all channels.
- `unreadChannelCount` tells you the number of channels that the current user has unread messages in.
