# Overview

Besides [Events](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/android/event_listening/?language=kotlin), push notifications are another way to stay up to date with changes in your chat in real time.

:::info
Members of a channel will receive a push notification if they don't have an open socket connection.
:::

To receive push notifications from Stream Chat, you'll need to:

1. Configure your push notification provider on the [Stream Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/).
2. Add the client-side integration for the chosen provider in your app.

We support the following providers:

- [Firebase](./02-firebase.mdx)
- Huawei Push Kit (Coming soon, stay tuned!)
- Mi Push (Coming soon, stay tuned!)

We ship an individual artifact for each of these to make client-side integration with their service quick and simple. See their individual documentation pages linked above for details.

## Customizing Push Notifications

If you want, you can also customize how the push notifications work.

There are two ways to customize push notifications:

* `NotificationConfig`: Customize notification resources and metadata.
* `ChatNotificationHandler`: Customize the default push notifications handling behaviour.

Let's see how to create a custom `ChatNotificationHandler`.

### Redirecting From a Notification To Your App

In order to redirect the user from notifications to a specific `Activity` in your app, you need to create a custom `ChatNotificationHandler`.

Here's an example of a custom handler:

```kotlin
class MyNotificationHandler(context: Context, notificationConfig: NotificationConfig) :
    ChatNotificationHandler(context, notificationConfig) {

    override fun getNewMessageIntent(
        messageId: String,
        channelType: String,
        channelId: String
    ): Intent = Intent(context, MainActivity::class.java).apply {
        putExtra(EXTRA_CHANNEL_ID, channelId)
        putExtra(EXTRA_CHANNEL_TYPE, channelType)
        putExtra(EXTRA_MESSAGE_ID, messageId)
    }

    companion object {
        const val EXTRA_CHANNEL_ID = "extra_channel_id"
        const val EXTRA_CHANNEL_TYPE = "extra_channel_type"
        const val EXTRA_MESSAGE_ID = "extra_message_id"
    }
}
```

You extended the `ChatNotificationHandler` to provide a custom implementation, and added an override for `getNewMessageIntent()`. This function allows you to intercept a notification and build a custom `Intent` that can point to any `Activity` in your app. You can also add custom data to the `Intent` if you need it.

Now that you've created a custom handler, you need to pass it into the `ChatClient.Builder` when initializing the Stream Android SDK:

```kotlin {4}
val notificationHandler = MyNotificationHandler(context, notificationsConfig)

ChatClient.Builder("api-key", context)
    .notifications(notificationHandler)
    .build()
```

:::note
Consider overriding `ChatNotificationHandler.getErrorCaseIntent()` for error case notifications.

### Customize Notification Data

The SDK also allows you to generate the notification UI that users see after they receive a push notification.

All you need to do is override `buildNotification()` as shown on the following example:

```kotlin
class MyNotificationHandler(context: Context, notificationConfig: NotificationConfig) :
    ChatNotificationHandler(context, notificationConfig) {

    override fun buildNotification(
        notificationId: Int,
        channel: Channel,
        message: Message
    ): NotificationCompat.Builder {
        // Build your notification, customizing the Notification Builder as needed
        return NotificationCompact.Builder(context, CHANNEL_NOTIFICATION_ID)
            .setDefaults(NotificationCompat.DEFAULT_ALL)
    }
}
```

Within `buildNotification()` you receive the `notificationId` and the `Channel` and `Message` that this notification came from. You can use the `NotificationCompat.Builder()` to customize the notification appearance and default values and behaviour.

Finally, pass in the `ChatNotificationHandler` implementation to the `ChatClient.Builder` when initializing the Stream Android SDK:

```kotlin {4}
val notificationHandler = MyNotificationHandler(context, notificationConfig)

ChatClient.Builder("api-key", context)
    .notifications(notificationHandler)
    .build()
```

### Dismissing notifications
Our UI Artifacts dismiss notifications related with a `Channel` as far as an user navigate to the channel conversation.
But if you need to manually dismiss them by some reason, you can call `ChatClient::dismissChannelNotifications` method providing the `channelType` and `channelId` from the `Channel` that you would like to dismiss notifications.
