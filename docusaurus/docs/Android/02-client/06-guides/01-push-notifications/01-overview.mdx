# Overview

Besides [Events](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/android/event_listening/?language=kotlin), push notifications are another way to stay up to date with changes in your chat in real time.

:::info
Members of a channel will receive a push notification if they don't have an open socket connection.
:::

To receive push notifications from Stream Chat, you'll need to:

1. Configure your push notification provider on the [Stream Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/).
2. Add the client-side integration for the chosen provider in your app.

We support the following providers:

- [Firebase Cloud Messaging](./02-firebase.mdx)
- [Huawei Push Kit](./03-huawei.mdx)
- Xiaomi Mi Push (Coming soon, stay tuned!)

We ship an individual artifact for each of these to make client-side integration with their service quick and simple. See their individual documentation pages linked above for details.
You need to add the list of `PushDeviceGenerator` you want to use:
```kotlin {1-5,8}
val notificationConfig = NotificationConfig(
    pushDeviceGenerators = listOf(
        // PushDeviceGenerator
    ),
)

ChatClient.Builder("api-key", context)
    .notifications(notificationConfig, notificationHandler)
    .build()
```

:::note
Push notifications are disabled by default on the client side. You can enable it by setting the `NotificationConfig::pushNotificationEnabled` property to `true`.
Keep in mind that the SDK creates a `NotificationChannel` during its initialization if push notifications are enabled client-side.
:::

## Customizing Push Notifications

If you want, you can also customize how the push notifications work.

You can customize push notifications in the following ways:
* Overriding resources: Lets you customize notification's icon and text resources
* `NotificationHandlerFactory`: Uses the styles we provide but customizes an intent the user triggers when clicking on a notification.
* `NotificationHandler`: Lets you fully customize how notifications are shown and dismissed
* `NotificationConfig::shouldShowNotificationOnPush`: Lets you decide whether to show a notification after receiving a push

### Overriding resources

You can provide custom icon and text resources displayed in notifications by overriding them:
- We are using [stream_ic_notification.xml](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/blob/main/stream-chat-android-client/src/main/res/drawable/stream_ic_notification.xml) drawable as the default notification's icon
- Text resources are placed inside [string.xml](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/blob/main/stream-chat-android-client/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) file

:::info
The SDK supports multiple languages. Make sure to override resources in all languages used in your app. Refer to [Adding Localization](../../../03-ui/06-guides/04-custom-translations.mdx) guide for more details.
:::

### Using our `NotificationHandlerFactory`

Our `NotificationHandlerFactory` provides a way to create a default implementation of `NotificationHandler` based on the Android API Level and lets you customize an intent that a user triggers by clicking the notification.
This function lets you provide a custom `Intent` that can point to any `Activity` in your app. You can also add custom data to the `Intent` if you need it.

```kotlin {1-12,15}
val notificationHandler = NotificationHandlerFactory.createNotificationHandler(
    context = context,
    newMessageIntent = {
        messageId: String,
        channelType: String,
        channelId: String,
         ->
        // Return the intent you want to be triggered when the notification is clicked
        val intent: Intent = [....]
        intent
    }
)

ChatClient.Builder("api-key", context)
    .notifications(notificationConfig, notificationHandler)
    .build()

```

### Customize Notification Style

The SDK lets you define the theming and behavior of the notification UI that users see after they receive a push notification.
To do this, implement the `NotificationHandler` interface and show your own notification.
If you want to dismiss notifications when a user visits a channel or logs off of the app, you will need to implement methods for dismissing notifications on the `NotificationHandler` class.

```kotlin {6,13,17}
class MyNotificationHandler(private val context: Context) : NotificationHandler {
    private val notificationManager: NotificationManager by lazy {
        context.getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as NotificationManager
    }

    override fun showNotification(channel: Channel, message: Message) {
        NotificationCompat.Builder(context, notificationChannelId)
            ... // Configure your own notification
            .build()
        notificationManager.notify(notificationId, notification)
    }

    override fun dismissChannelNotifications(channelType: String, channelId: String) {
        // Dismiss all notification related with this channel
    }

    override fun dismissAllNotifications() {
        // Dismiss all notifications
    }
}
```

Finally, pass as the `NotificationHandler` implementation to the `ChatClient.Builder` when initializing the Stream Android SDK:

```kotlin {4}
val notificationHandler = MyNotificationHandler(context)

ChatClient.Builder("api-key", context)
    .notifications(notificationConfig, notificationHandler)
    .build()
```

### Dismissing notifications

Our [`MessageListView`](../../../03-ui/05-components/05-message-list.mdx) UI component and [`MessageList`](../../../04-compose/04-message-components/03-message-list.mdx) Compose UI Component automatically dismiss notifications related to a `Channel` when the user opens it.

If you need to dismiss them manually (for example, if you are using a custom `MessageListView` component) you can call the `ChatClient::dismissChannelNotifications` method, providing the `channelType` and `channelId` from the `Channel` that you would like to dismiss notifications:

```kotlin
ChatClient.dismissChannelNotifications("messaging", "general")
```

Notifications are also automatically dismissed when the user logs out from the SDK.
