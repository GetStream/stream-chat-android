## Receiving Notifications in the Client

We provide an artifact with all the implementation needed to work with **Firebase**. To use it follow the next steps:

Start by [adding Firebase to your Android project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client). You only need to set up the FCM dependencies and add a _google-services.json_ file to your project source directory.

Next, add the Stream Firebase push provider artifact to your app's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.getstream:stream-chat-android-pushprovider-firebase:$stream_version"
}
```

Finally, add the `FirebasePushDeviceGenerator` to your `NotificationConfig` and pass it into the `ChatClient.Builder` when you initialize the SDK:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin {2,5}
val notificationConfig = NotificationConfig(
    pushDeviceGenerators = listOf(FirebasePushDeviceGenerator())
)
ChatClient.Builder("apiKey", context)
    .notifications(notificationConfig)
    .build()
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
boolean pushNotificationEnabled = true;
List<PushDeviceGenerator> pushDeviceGeneratorList = Collections.singletonList(new FirebasePushDeviceGenerator());
NotificationConfig notificationConfig = new NotificationConfig(pushNotificationEnabled, pushDeviceGeneratorList);
new ChatClient.Builder("apiKey", context)
        .notifications(notificationConfig)
        .build();
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution
Make sure that _ChatClient_ is always initialized before handling push notifications. We highly recommend initializing it in the `Application` class.

That's it! You can now receive push notifications from Stream via Firebase!

### Using a Custom Firebase Messaging Service

The Stream Firebase push provider artifact includes an implementation of `FirebaseMessagingService` that will send new Firebase tokens and incoming push messages to the Stream SDK.

If you're also using Firebase notifications for other things in your app, you can use your own custom service instead. This should make the following calls to the `FirebaseMessagingDelegate` class:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin {6,14}
class CustomFirebaseMessagingService : FirebaseMessagingService() {

    override fun onNewToken(token: String) {
        // Update device's token on Stream backend
        try {
            FirebaseMessagingDelegate.registerFirebaseToken(token, "optional-provider-name")
        } catch (exception: IllegalStateException) {
            // ChatClient was not initialized
        }
    }

    override fun onMessageReceived(message: RemoteMessage) {
        try {
            if (FirebaseMessagingDelegate.handleRemoteMessage(message)) {
                // RemoteMessage was from Stream and it is already processed
            } else {
                // RemoteMessage wasn't sent from Stream and it needs to be handled by you
            }
        } catch (exception: IllegalStateException) {
            // ChatClient was not initialized
        }
    }
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
public final class CustomFirebaseMessagingService extends FirebaseMessagingService {

    @Override
    public void onNewToken(@NonNull String token) {
        // Update device's token on Stream backend
        try {
            FirebaseMessagingDelegate.registerFirebaseToken(token, "optional-provider-name");
        } catch (IllegalStateException exception) {
            // ChatClient was not initialized
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onMessageReceived(@NonNull RemoteMessage message) {
        try {
            if (FirebaseMessagingDelegate.handleRemoteMessage(message)) {
                // RemoteMessage was from Stream and it is already processed
            } else {
                // RemoteMessage wasn't sent from Stream and it needs to be handled by you
            }
        } catch (IllegalStateException exception) {
            // ChatClient was not initialized
        }
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
Make sure that your custom service has an [`<intent-filter>` priority](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element#priority) higher than `-1` to override our default service. (This priority is `0` by default.)
