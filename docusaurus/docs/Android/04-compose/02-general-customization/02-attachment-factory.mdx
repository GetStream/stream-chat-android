# Custom Attachments

The `AttachmentFactory` class allows you to build your own attachments to display in the [Message List](../04-message-components/03-message-list.mdx). It exposes the following properties and behavior:

```kotlin
public open class AttachmentFactory(
    public val canHandle: (attachments: List<Attachment>) -> Boolean,
    public val content: @Composable (AttachmentState) -> Unit,
)
```

* `canHandle`: Lambda function that accepts a list of attachments in a message and returns `true` if a given factory can consume the attachments and show some UI.
* `content`: Defines the composable function that accepts an `AttachmentState` and shows a given attachment component.

There are a few examples of default attachment factory implementations, in the [`StreamAttachmentFactories.kt` file](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/blob/main/stream-chat-android-compose/src/main/java/io/getstream/chat/android/compose/ui/theme/StreamAttachmentFactories.kt):

```kotlin
public fun defaultFactories(
    linkDescriptionLineLimit: Int = DEFAULT_LINK_DESCRIPTION_LINE_LIMIT,
): List<AttachmentFactory> = listOf(
    LinkAttachmentFactory(linkDescriptionLineLimit),
    GiphyAttachmentFactory(),
    ImageAttachmentFactory(),
    FileAttachmentFactory()
)
```

These factories perform specific checks that you can explore by opening each specific factory.

Each of these factories supplies a predicate, as well as a content composable lambda function that provides the appropriate content.

To customize the factories your code uses, you can always override the `attachmentFactories` parameter of the `ChatTheme` wrapper:

```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    val defaultFactories = StreamAttachmentFactories.defaultFactories()

    setContent {
        // override the default factories by adding your own
        ChatTheme(attachmentFactories = myAttachmentFactories + defaultFactories) {
            ChannelsScreen(...)
        }
    }
}
```

That way, you can build any type of factories you want, to show things like the user location within a Google Maps component, audio files, videos and more.
