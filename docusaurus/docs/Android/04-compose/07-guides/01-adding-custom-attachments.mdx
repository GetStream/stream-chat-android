# Adding Custom Attachments

## Introduction

By default Stream Chat supports several built-in attachment types like image, video, file and giphy. Apart from that, you can also add your own types of attachments such as location, contact, audio, sticker, etc.

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to build a date sharing feature. Chat users will be able to pick a date from a calendar, preview their selection in the message composer and see the sent attachment within a message in the message list.

This involves doing the following steps:
1. Implementing a custom message composer that is capable of sending a message with `date` attachments.
2. Adding support for `date` attachments by creating a custom [AttachmentFactory](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/android/compose/general-customization/attachment-factory/).

## Sending Date Attachments

To begin with, you'll need a custom message composer with a button to pick dates. Here's the code for this component:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun CustomMessageComposer(
    viewModel: MessageComposerViewModel,
    onDateSelected: (Long) -> Unit,
) {
    val activity = LocalContext.current as AppCompatActivity

    MessageComposer(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxWidth()
            .wrapContentHeight(),
        viewModel = viewModel,
        integrations = { // here
            IconButton(
                modifier = Modifier
                    .size(48.dp)
                    .padding(12.dp),
                content = {
                    Icon(
                        painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.ic_calendar),
                        contentDescription = null,
                        tint = ChatTheme.colors.textLowEmphasis
                    )
                },
                onClick = {
                    MaterialDatePicker.Builder
                        .datePicker()
                        .build()
                        .apply {
                            show(activity.supportFragmentManager, null)
                            addOnPositiveButtonClickListener {
                                onDateSelected(it)
                            }
                        }
                }
            )
        }
    )
}
```
For simplicity, the `integration` section to the left of the message input has only one button that is used to show the date picker dialog.

What's happening here is that within the `integrations`, you define a custom button to open the picker. Within its `onClick`, you build a new `MaterialDatePicker` and show it using `activity.supportFragmentManager`.

If the user selects a date and selects the positive button, you proceed to call `onDateSelected()` and update the state. But more on that later.

Next, you'll need to create a custom messages screen that makes use of the composer that you've created above:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun CustomMessagesScreen(
    channelId: String,
    onBackPressed: () -> Unit = {}
) {
    val factory = MessagesViewModelFactory(
        context = LocalContext.current,
        channelId = channelId,
    )

    val composerViewModel = viewModel(MessageComposerViewModel::class.java, factory = factory)

    // Other declarations
    
    Box(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
        Scaffold(
            modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
            topBar = {
                // Message list header
            },
            bottomBar = {
                // 1
                CustomMessageComposer(
                    viewModel = composerViewModel,
                    onDateSelected = {
                        // 2
                        val date = DateFormat
                            .getDateInstance(DateFormat.LONG)
                            .format(Date(it))
                        val attachment = Attachment(
                            type = "date",
                            extraData = mutableMapOf("payload" to date)
                        )
                        // 3
                        composerViewModel.addSelectedAttachments(listOf(attachment))
                    }
                )
            }
        ) {
            // Message list
        }
    }
}
```

:::note
The full source code of the `CustomMessagesScreen` component is available [here](https://github.com/GetStream/Android-Samples/blob/main/compose-custom-attachments/src/main/java/io/getstream/chat/android/compose/customattachments/ui/CustomMessagesScreen.kt).
:::

In the snippet above, you:

1. Make use of the newly created custom message composer in our messages screen, as the `bottomBar`.
2. Create a custom attachment of type `date` carrying the selected date as a payload.
3. Submit the attachment with the selected date to the message composer.

Now you can send a custom attachment of type `date` to the chat. The resulting UI will look like this:

![Sending Custom Attachment](../../assets/compose_sending_custom_attachments.png)

Now that you've set up the `DatePicker` and the custom composer, you need to build a custom attachment factory to render the item both in the input and the list. 

## Rendering Date Attachments

Let's see how to create an [AttachmentFactory](../03-general-customization/02-attachment-factory.mdx) that is capable of handling date attachments:

```kotlin
val dateAttachmentFactory: AttachmentFactory = AttachmentFactory(
    canHandle = { attachments -> attachments.any { it.type == "date" } },
    content = @Composable { modifier, attachmentState ->
      // Composable that represents the UI of "date" attachments in the message list
    },
    previewContent = { modifier, attachments, onAttachmentRemoved ->
      // Composable that represents the UI of "date" attachments in the message input
    },
    textFormatter = { attachment -> 
      // String representation of the attachment in the channel list
    }
)
```

There are four important parts of each attachment factory:

* `canHandle`: Describes the condition that tells our components if the factory can handle a given set of attachments.
* `content`: Represents the attachment UI within the `MessageList`.
* `previewContent`: Represents the attachment UI within the `MessageComposer`.
* `textFormatter`: Shows the attachment information formatted for our `ChannelItem`s.

Let's start with creating a component for the message input:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun DateAttachmentPreviewContent(
    attachments: List<Attachment>,
    onAttachmentRemoved: (Attachment) -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
) {
    val attachment = attachments.first { it.type == "date" }
    val formattedDate = attachment.extraData["payload"].toString()

    Box(
        modifier = modifier
            .wrapContentHeight()
            .clip(RoundedCornerShape(16.dp))
            .background(color = ChatTheme.colors.barsBackground)
    ) {
        Text(
            modifier = Modifier
                .align(Alignment.CenterStart)
                .padding(16.dp)
                .fillMaxWidth(),
            text = formattedDate,
            style = ChatTheme.typography.body,
            maxLines = 1,
            color = ChatTheme.colors.textHighEmphasis
        )

        CancelIcon(
            modifier = Modifier
                .align(Alignment.TopEnd)
                .padding(4.dp),
            onClick = { onAttachmentRemoved(attachment) }
        )
    }
}
```

Then, create a component that will be rendered in the message list:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun DateAttachmentContent(
    attachmentState: AttachmentState,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
) {
    val attachment = attachmentState.message.attachments.first { it.type == "date" }
    val formattedDate = attachment.extraData["payload"].toString()

    Column(
        modifier = modifier
            .fillMaxWidth()
            .padding(4.dp)
            .clip(ChatTheme.shapes.attachment)
            .background(ChatTheme.colors.infoAccent)
            .padding(8.dp)
    ) {
        Row(
            horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(8.dp),
            verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically
        ) {
            Icon(
                modifier = Modifier.size(16.dp),
                painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.ic_calendar),
                contentDescription = null,
                tint = ChatTheme.colors.textHighEmphasis,
            )

            Text(
                text = formattedDate,
                style = ChatTheme.typography.body,
                maxLines = 1,
                color = ChatTheme.colors.textHighEmphasis
            )
        }
    }
}
```

What's important here is how you're able to fetch the custom attachment data, using `attachment.extraData["payload"]`. You can format the data in any way you want here, which makes our attachments very powerful.

Finally, you need to provide a string representation of the attachment for message preview:

```kotlin
textFormatter = { attachment -> 
    attachment.extraData["payload"].toString()
}
```

Now your attachment factory is complete and looks like that:

```kotlin
@ExperimentalStreamChatApi
val dateAttachmentFactory: AttachmentFactory = AttachmentFactory(
    canHandle = { attachments -> attachments.any { it.type == "date" } },
    content = @Composable { modifier, attachmentState ->
        DateAttachmentContent(
            modifier = modifier,
            attachmentState = attachmentState
        )
    },
    previewContent = { modifier, attachments, onAttachmentRemoved ->
        DateAttachmentPreviewContent(
            modifier = modifier,
            attachments = attachments,
            onAttachmentRemoved = onAttachmentRemoved
        )
    },
    textFormatter = { attachment -> 
      attachment.extraData["payload"].toString()
    },
)
```

To complete the date sharing feature you just need to provide `dateAttachmentFactory` along with the default attachment factories via `ChatTheme`:

```kotlin
class MessagesActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        val channelId = requireNotNull(intent.getStringExtra(KEY_CHANNEL_ID))

        val customFactories = listOf(dateAttachmentFactory)
        val defaultFactories = StreamAttachmentFactories.defaultFactories()

        setContent {
            // pass in custom factories or combine them with the default ones
            ChatTheme(attachmentFactories = customFactories + defaultFactories) {
                CustomMessagesScreen(
                    channelId = channelId,
                    onBackPressed = { finish() }
                )
            }
        }
    }

    companion object {
        private const val KEY_CHANNEL_ID = "channelId"

        fun getIntent(context: Context, channelId: String): Intent {
            return Intent(context, MessagesActivity::class.java).apply {
                putExtra(KEY_CHANNEL_ID, channelId)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Date attachments should be now correctly rendered in the message composer and in the message list like on the screenshot below:

![Rendering Custom Attachment](../../assets/compose_rendering_custom_attachments.png)

With just a few lines of code, you're able to render any custom UI within the `MessageComposer` and `MessageList` components of our SDK. This gives the ability to build powerful features without having to change our default components — you just need a custom `AttachmentFactory`!
