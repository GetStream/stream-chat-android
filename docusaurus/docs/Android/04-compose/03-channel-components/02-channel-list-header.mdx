# ChannelListHeader

The `ChannelListHeader` component allows you to display a header for the channel screen. It sets up the following:

* `leadingContent`: Shows the current user image. The style is applied from the `ChatTheme` wrapper. <!-- TODO WIP PAGE -->
* `ChannelHeaderTitle`: A component that shows the title of the header, or a loading view if there's no network available.
* `trailingContent`: A customizable trailing action shown at the end of the header, exposed as a parameter.  `DefaultChannelListHeaderAction` by default.

Let's see how to use the header.

## Usage

To use the `ChannelListHeader`, you can add it to your UI, within `setContent()`:

```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        
    setContent {
        ChatTheme {
            ChannelListHeader(
                modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
                currentUser = user,
                title = "My Awesome App",
            )
        }
    }
}
```

This will produce the UI below:

:::note 
The `ChannelListHeader` can be used without any parameters, but we advise that you pass in the title of your app, the current user, as well as the action handlers.
:::

Next, let's see how to handle actions in the header.

## Handling Actions

The `ChannelListHeader` exposes two main actions you can override and handle yourself, as per the signature:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ChannelListHeader(
  ..., // State
  onAvatarClick: (User?) -> Unit = {},
  onHeaderActionClick: () -> Unit = {}
)
```

* `onAvatarClick`: Handler when the user taps on their own avatar.
* `onHeaderActionClick`: Handler when the user taps on the trailing action. This is only used if you don't override the `action` parameter, which defines the UI for the trailing icon.

:::note 

The `action` parameter uses the `onHeaderActionClick` parameter for the default header action. If you want to keep the same UI but override the behavior, you need to change `onHeaderActionClick`. Otherwise, skip over to **Customization** to learn how to customize the action UI.

:::

To override the actions, you can use the following approach:

```kotlin
ChannelListHeader(
    ..., // State
    onHeaderActionClick = {}, // Default header action
    onAvatarClick = {} // Avatar click action
)
```

These two parameters let you gain more control over the behavior of the `ChannelListHeader`. Let's see how to customize the appearance next.

## Customization

In terms of UI customization, the `ChannelListHeader` exposes the following properties:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ChannelListHeader(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    title: String = "",
    currentUser: User? = ChatClient.instance().getCurrentUser(),
    connectionState = ConnectionState.CONNECTED,
    leadingContent: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit = { DefaultChannelHeaderLeadingContent(currentUser, onAvatarClick) },
    titleContent: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit = {
        ChannelHeaderTitle(
            modifier = Modifier.weight(1f),
            connectionState = connectionState,
            title = title
        )
    },
    trailingContent: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit = { DefaultChannelListHeaderAction(onHeaderActionClick) },
    ... // Action handlers
)
```

* `modifier`: Modifier for the root component styling. You can add things like a background, elevation, padding and more.
* `title`: The text to show when you're connected to the Internet.
* `currentUser`: The state of the current user, for displaying the `Avatar`.
* `connectionState`: The state of WebSocket connection, used to switch between the title and the the `NetworkLoadingView`.
* `leadingContent`: Customizable composable function parameter that overrides the leading action. This allows you to either:
    * override the default behavior but keep the UI by overriding `onAvatarClick`,
    * or override both the UI and behavior by changing the `leadingContent` parameter from the default to your own.
* `titleContent`: Customizable composable function parameter that overrides the title content. This allows you to either:
    * override the shown data but keep the UI, by passing in the `title` and `connectionState`.
    * or override both the UI and behavior by changing the `titleContent` parameter from the default to your own.
* `trailingContent`: Customizable composable function parameter that overrides the trailing action. This allows you to either:
    * override the default behavior but keep the UI by overriding `onHeaderActionClick`,
    * or override both the UI and behavior by changing the `trailingContent` parameter from the default to your own.

Here's an example of customizing the UI of the header:

```kotlin
ChannelListHeader(
    // Customizing the appearance
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
    connectionState = ConnectionState.CONNECTING,
    currentUser = user,
    title = "My Chat App",
    trailingContent = { // Customizing the trailing action
        Icon(
            modifier = Modifier.clickable {
                // Click handler for the custom action
            },
            imageVector = Icons.Default.Add,
            contentDescription = "Add",
            tint = ChatTheme.colors.textHighEmphasis
        )
    }
)
```

By passing in various pieces of data, you control which image is loaded for the `Avatar`, what title is shown, if you need to show the `NetworkLoadingView` or not and finally, what action to show at the end of the header. 

By overriding the `trailingContent` parameter, you replace the default action UI with your custom UI, and by adding a `clickable {}` modifier, you can add click actions on the custom component. This allows you to customize both the UI and behavior!

The snippet above will produce the following UI.

<!-- TODO WIP PAGE You can also choose to build a completely custom header and integrate with the rest of our components. To learn how to do that, read our [Building Custom Screens](../07-guides/06-building-custom-screens.mdx) guide. -->
