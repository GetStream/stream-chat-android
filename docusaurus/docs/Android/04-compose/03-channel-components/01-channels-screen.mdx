# ChannelsScreen

The easiest way to set up a screen that shows the active user's channels and give them the ability to search for a specific channel is to use the `ChannelsScreen`.

`ChannelsScreen` sets up four components internally:

* [`ChannelListHeader`](./02-channel-list-header.mdx): Shows the information of the current user and exposes a trailing action.
* `SearchInput`: Allows users to search for channels by name. <!-- TODO WIP PAGE -->
* [`ChannelList`](./03-channel-list.mdx): The core part of the screen, which renders channels for the active user, based on defined filters.
* [`ChannelInfo`](./04-channel-info.mdx): A bottom drawer that is shown when long clicking on a `Channel` in the list.

It also sets up all the business logic and styles the UI according to our default design system.

## Usage

To use `ChannelsScreen`, you just need to call it within `setContent()` in your `Activity` or `Fragment`:

```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

    setContent {
        ChatTheme {
            ChannelsScreen()
        }
    }
}
```

:::note 
The `ChannelsScreen` can be used without any parameters, but we advise that you pass in the title of your app, as well as the action handlers.

This small snippet will produce a fully-working solution, as shown in the image below.

To get a better feel of the component, you'll want to customize its actions.

## Handling Actions

When it comes to action handlers exposed in the `ChannelsScreen` signature you have access to the following:

```kotlin
fun ChannelsScreen(
	..., // Filters and UI customization
    onHeaderClickAction: () -> Unit = {},
    onItemClick: (Channel) -> Unit = {},
    onViewChannelInfoAction: (Channel) -> Unit = {},
    onBackPressed: () -> Unit = {},
)
```

There are four main action handlers you can use with the `ChannelsScreen`:

* `onHeaderClickAction`: Handler for the default header trailing icon click action.
* `onItemClick`: Handler for a `Channel` being clicked.
* `onViewChannelInfoAction`: Handler for the **View info** action selected in `ChannelInfo`. 
* `onBackPressed`: Handler for the system back button being clicked.

All of these actions are empty by default, but if you want to customize them, you can do the following:

```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

    setContent {
        ChatTheme {
            ChannelsScreen(
                onItemClick = ::openMessages,
                onHeaderClickAction = {
                    // Handle the header click action
                },
                onBackPressed = { finish() },
                onViewChannelInfoAction = {
                    // Show UI to view more channel info
                },
            )
        }
    }
}
```

## Customization

`ChannelsScreen` is one of our **screen components** and as such, it doesn't offer much customization. As with any component, you can customize the content theme and styling by wrapping it the [`ChatTheme`](../02-general-customization/01-chat-theme.mdx).

When it comes to UI and behavior customization in the `ChannelsScreen` signature, you have access to the following:

```kotlin
fun ChannelsScreen(
    filters: FilterObject = Filters.and(
        Filters.eq("type", "messaging"),
        Filters.`in`("members", listOf(ChatClient.instance().getCurrentUser()?.id ?: ""))
    ),
    querySort: QuerySort<Channel> = QuerySort.Companion.desc("id"),
    title: String = "Stream Chat",
    isShowingHeader: Boolean = true,
    isShowingSearch: Boolean = true,
    ... // action handlers
)
```

* `filters`: These filters are applied to the channel query, meaning you can customize what data to show in the list.
* `querySort`: Like with filters, these are applied to the list data and affect its sorting order.
* `title`: The title of the `ChannelListHeader`.
* `isShowingHeader`: Flag that affects if we show the `ChannelListHeader`. `true` by default.
* `isShowingSearch`: Flag that affects if we show the `SearchInput`. `true` by default.
