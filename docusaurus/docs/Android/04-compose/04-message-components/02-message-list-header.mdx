# MessageListHeader

The `MessageListHeader` component is a clean, stateless component, that doesn't require a `ViewModel`. It consists of three internal components by default and it
allows you to customize the data, design style, action handlers and the internal components.

Let's see how to use it in your UI.

## Usage

To use the component, simply combine it with the rest of your UI, e.g. in `setContent`, in you `Activity` or `Fragment`:

```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    
    // Load the data for the header here
    
    setContent {
        Column(Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
            MessageListHeader(
                channel,
                currentUser,
                isNetworkAvailable,
                messageMode,
                modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
                onBackPressed = { },
                onHeaderActionClick = { },
            )

            // Rest of your UI
        }
    }
}
```

This component doesn't have its own `ViewModel`, as it's stateless. You need to provide the data to the header, otherwise it doesn't know what to render.

We recommend using either our `ChatDomain` directly and combining information you get from it, or the `MessageListViewModel`, in pair with the rest of our components, for ease of use.

The snippet above, after providing the data, generates the following UI:

Now let's see how to handle the header actions.

## Handling Actions

The `MessageListHeader` exposes two actions, as per the signature:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MessageListHeader(
    ..., // State
    onBackPressed: () -> Unit = {},
    onHeaderActionClick: (Channel) -> Unit = {},
)
```

* `onBackPressed`: Handler for the `BackButton` click action.
* `onHeaderActionClick`: Handler when the user clicks on the title for more information about the channel.

To customize these actions, simply use the `MessageListHeader` with the rest of your UI components, like within `setContent`, and pass in the required actions:

```kotlin
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        // Load required data

        setContent {
            Column(Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
                MessageListHeader(
                    ..., // State
                    onBackPressed = { finish() },
                    onHeaderActionClick = { 
                      // Show your custom UI
                    }
                )

                // Rest of your UI
            }
        }
    }
```

This way it's easy to combine the actions from this component with your custom UI and logic.

## Customization

As the component is fully state-dependent, you can customize the data it shows, as per the signature:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MessageListHeader(
    channel: Channel,
    currentUser: User?,
    isNetworkAvailable: Boolean = true,
    messageMode: MessageMode = Normal,
    ..., // content
    ... // actions
)
```

* `channel`: The information about the current channel, used to show the member count, name and avatar data.
* `currentUser`: Currently logged in user, used to differentiate it from other users, when loading the channel image.
* `isNetworkAvailable`: Used to switch between the `NetworkLoadingView` and the member count text.
* `messageMode`: Used to determine the header title. If we're in a thread, we show a title saying who the owner of the parent message is.

These will change what data is displayed in the header.

You can also customize the content of the header, using the following parameters:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MessageListHeader(
    leadingContent: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit = {
        BackButton(
            modifier = Modifier
                .size(36.dp),
            imageVector = Icons.Default.ArrowBack,
            onBackPressed = onBackPressed,
        )
    },

    titleContent: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit = {
        DefaultMessageHeaderTitle(
            modifier = Modifier.weight(6f),
            channel = channel,
            messageMode = messageMode,
            onHeaderActionClick = onHeaderActionClick,
            isNetworkAvailable = isNetworkAvailable
        )
    },
    trailingContent: @Composable RowScope.() -> Unit = {
        ChannelAvatar(
            modifier = Modifier.size(36.dp),
            channel = channel,
            currentUser = currentUser,
            contentDescription = channel.name,
        )
    },
)
```

* `leadingContent`: Represents the leading content part of the header. By default the `BackButton`.
* `titleContent`: Represents the core and center part of the header. Shows either more information about the channel using a `DefaultMessageHeaderTitle`, or a `NetworkLoadingView`, based on whether the network is available or not.
* `trailingContent`: Represents the content at the end of the header. By default the 'ChannelAvatar'.

You can override each of these parameters that represent different slots in the header.
