# Customizing Components

The `ChatTheme` component is a wrapper that **you should use as the root** of all Compose UI Components. It's used to provide the default properties that help us style the application, such as:

* `isDarkTheme`: Flag that determines if the application should be themed in light or dark mode.
* `colors`: Defines a palette of colors we support in the app. These are applied to all components and provide us with a dark/light mode by default, but can be used to override the design system completely.
* `dimens`: Used for defining the dimensions of various components such as avatars, attachment content, reactions etc.
* `typography`: Used for all text elements, to apply different text styles to each component. Can be used to change the typography completely.
* `shapes`: Defines several shapes we use across our Compose UI components. Can be used to change the shape of messages, input fields, avatars and attachments.
* `rippleTheme`: Defines the appearance for ripples. Can be used to override the ripple colors used in light and dark modes.
* `attachmentFactories`: Used to process messages and show different types of attachment UI, given the provided factories. Can be used to override the UI for file, image and link attachments, as well as to add custom attachment types.
* `attachmentPreviewHandlers`: Used to provide previews for all supported attachment types. If you do not wish to use the default previews, you can customize this.
* `quotedAttachmentFactories`: Used to process messages and show different types of attachment UI, when quoting a message that contains an attachment.
* `reactionIconFactory`: Used to create a reaction icon for the given reaction type. You can use the default factory that supports a predefined set of reactions, or provide a custom one.
* `dateFormatter`: Used to define the timestamp formatting in the app. You can use the default formatting, or customize it to your needs.
* `channelNameFormatter`: Used to define the channel name formatting in the app. You can use the default implementation, or customize it according to your needs.
* `messagePreviewFormatter`: Used to define the message preview formatting in the app. You can use the default implementation, or customize the display of message previews according to your needs.
* `imageLoaderFactory`: Used to create Coil image loader instances. You can use the default image loader factory, or provide a custom one.
* `messageAlignmentProvider`: Used to provide an alignment for a particular message. You can use the default implementation which aligns the messages of the current user to end, or customize it according to your needs.
* `messageOptionItemVisibility`: Used to control menu item visibility in the selected message options menu. All options are visible by default.
* `messageOptionsUserReactionAlignment`: Used to define how message reactions are aligned when browsing all reactions for a given message.
* `permissionHandlers`: Used to handle permissions inside the app. Default implementation of the download permission handler automatically downloads files after the permission has been granted.
* `attachmentsPickerTabFactories`: Used to display different tabs in the attachments picker dialog.
* `videoThumbnailsEnabled`: Dictates whether video thumbnails will be displayed inside video previews. They are a paid feature and enabled by default and the pricing can be found [here](https://getstream.io/chat/pricing/).

Let's see how to use the `ChatTheme` and how to customize the UI within.

## Using ChatTheme

To use the `ChatTheme`, simply wrap your UI content with it, like in the following example:

```kotlin {5,15}
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

    setContent {
        ChatTheme {
            MessagesScreen(
                viewModelFactory = MessagesViewModelFactory(
                    context = this,
                    channelId = "messaging:123",
                    messageLimit = 30
                ),
                onBackPressed = { finish() },
                onHeaderTitleClick = {}
            )
        }
    }
}
```

The `ChatTheme` provides default implementations for all its styling properties. That way, you can keep using our default color palette, typography, shapes, attachment factories and reaction types.

All you have to do is pass in the UI content you want to show, within its trailing lambda. This snippet above will produce the following UI. You'll also notice that if you switch to the dark theme in your system UI, the app will re-draw accordingly.

| Light theme | Dark theme |
| --- | --- |
| ![Default MessagesScreen component](../../assets/compose_default_messages_screen_component.png) | ![Default Dark Mode MessagesScreen Component](../../assets/compose_default_messages_screen_component_dark.png) |

Let's see how to customize the theme.

## Customization

To customize the `ChatTheme`, simply override any of the default properties by passing in your custom design style, like so:

```kotlin
setContent {
    ChatTheme(
        shapes = StreamShapes.defaultShapes().copy( // Customizing the shapes
            avatar = RoundedCornerShape(8.dp),
            attachment = RoundedCornerShape(16.dp),
            inputField = RectangleShape,
            myMessageBubble = RoundedCornerShape(16.dp),
            otherMessageBubble = RoundedCornerShape(16.dp),
            bottomSheet = RoundedCornerShape(topStart = 16.dp, topEnd = 16.dp)
        )
    ) {
        MessagesScreen(
            viewModelFactory = MessagesViewModelFactory(
                context = this,
                channelId = "messaging:123",
            ),
            onBackPressed = { finish() },
            onHeaderTitleClick = {}
        )
    }
}
```

In the snippet above, we customized the shapes to be different from the default values. We made the message bubbles rounded, the input field rectangular and the avatar a rounded rectangle.

This snippet above will produce the following screen:

| Light Theme | Dark Theme |
|---|---|
| ![Custom ChatTheme Component](../../assets/compose_custom_chat_theme_component.png) | ![Custom ChatTheme Component](../../assets/compose_custom_chat_theme_component_dark.png) |

It's really easy to customize these properties or provide static customization that you just reuse all over your app.

Let's see what each property exposes and what the values are used for.

### StreamColors

`StreamColors` are used to represent all the colors we use and apply to our components in the SDK.

You can find the definitions of all the colors we expose in the [class documentation](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/blob/main/stream-chat-android-compose/src/main/java/io/getstream/chat/android/compose/ui/theme/StreamColors.kt), as well as what the default provided colors are.

You can also browse which components are using the colors, to know what will be affected by any change.

### StreamDimens

`StreamDimens` defines different sizes that can be customized in the SDK.

You can find the definitions of all the dimensions we expose in the [class documentation](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/blob/main/stream-chat-android-compose/src/main/java/io/getstream/chat/android/compose/ui/theme/StreamDimens.kt), as well as what the default dimensions are.

You can also browse which components are using the dimensions, to know what will be affected by any change.

### StreamTypography

`StreamTypography` is used to apply different font weights and sizes to our textual UI components.

You can find all the text style properties we expose in the [class documentation](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/blob/main/stream-chat-android-compose/src/main/java/io/getstream/chat/android/compose/ui/theme/StreamTypography.kt), as well as what the default styles are.
