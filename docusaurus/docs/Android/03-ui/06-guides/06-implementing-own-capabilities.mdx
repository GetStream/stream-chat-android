# Implementing Own Capabilities

Each `Channel` has a list of capabilities that can be performed in it, such as muting a user, deleting messages and many
others. Not all channels should have the same capabilities neither should all users, which is where own capabilities
come into play.

Inside of `Channel` you will find a property with a signature `ownCapabilities: Set<String>`. Which channel capabilities
this set contains depends on the current user’s role (e.g. admin, guest, etc.), the channel type (e.g. messaging,
livestream, etc.) and channel level settings. You can read more about channel
capabilities [here](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/android/channel_capabilities/?language=kotlin) and more about channel
level settings [here](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/android/channel-level_settings/).

## Integrating channel capabilities into the UI

If you are using our own UI in combination with our `ViewModel`s, then own capabilities work out of the box without any
additional effort from your side, otherwise you will have to pass the correct set of capabilities to individual components.

Different components have different ways of passing own capabilities to them, so we’ll go through them individually.

:::note
As a safety precaution, by default own capabilities are initially set to an empty set, this means that a user has no capabilities. Setting it to a set containing all capabilities will give the user potentially dangerous capabilities such as the ability to delete any message.

### MessageListView

Inside `MessageListView` you will find the following function:

```kotlin
public fun setOwnCapabilities(ownCapabilities: Set<String>)
```

After setting own capabilities, the following capabilities will be regulated:

- send-reaction
- send-reply
- pin-message
- delete-any-message
- delete-own-message
- update-any-message
- update-own-message
- ban-channel-members

### MessageInputView

Inside `MessageInputView` you will find the following function:

```kotlin
public fun setOwnCapabilities(ownCapabilities: Set<String>)
```

After setting own capabilities, the following capabilities will be regulated:

- send-message
- send-links
- upload-file
- send-typing-events

### ChannelListView

If you use our `ChannelListView` as is, no further action is needed as it is set up to use own
capabilities.

It regulates the following capabilities.

- leave-channel
- delete-channel

`ChannelListView` contains the following function:

```kotlin
public fun setMoreOptionsClickListener(listener: ChannelClickListener?)
```

Should you wish to use it in order to override the default behavior, you will have to implement a UI capable of
correctly using own capabilities.

### Other capabilities

There are channel capabilities which are not implemented in the SDK because we do not offer the corresponding components
or the functionality.
You can implement these yourself after creating the correct components.

These are as follows:

- freeze-channel
- set-channel-cooldown
- update-channel
- update-channel-members
- search-messages

Please note that while we do offer a search component, its functionality is not simple enough to be regulated by the 'search-messages' capability.
