# Implementing Own Capabilities

Each `Channel` has a list of capabilities that can be performed in it, such as muting a user, deleting messages and many
others. Not all channels should have the same capabilities neither should all users, which is where own capabilities
come into play.

Inside of `Channel` you will find a property with a signature `ownCapabilities: Set<String>`. Which channel capabilities
this set contains depends on the current user’s role (for example admin, guest, etc.), the channel type (for example messaging,
livestream, etc.) and channel level settings. You can read more about channel
capabilities [here](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/android/channel_capabilities/?language=kotlin) and more about channel
level settings [here](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/android/channel-level_settings/).

## Integrating channel capabilities into the UI

If you are using our UI components bound to our `ViewModel`s, then own capabilities work out of the box without any
additional effort from your side, otherwise you will have to pass the correct set of capabilities to individual components.

Different components have different ways of passing own capabilities to them, so we’ll go through them individually.
Capabilities that were a part of the minimal chat experience before the introduction of own capabilities will be highlighted in bold with an asterisk next to them.

:::note
As a safety precaution, by default own capabilities are initially set to an empty set, this means that a user has no capabilities. Setting it to a set containing all capabilities will give the user potentially dangerous capabilities such as the ability to delete any message.

### MessageListView

Inside `MessageListView` you will find the following function:

```kotlin
public fun setOwnCapabilities(ownCapabilities: Set<String>)
```

After setting own capabilities, the following capabilities will be regulated:

- **send-reaction * **
- **send-reply * **
- pin-message
- delete-any-message
- **delete-own-message * **
- update-any-message
- **update-own-message * **
- ban-channel-members

:::note
For this component, as well as all the other examples, the capabilities in bold are a part of the "default" behavior that is set up for most users in the dashboard.

### MessageComposerView

Inside `MessageComposerView` you will find the following function:

```kotlin
public fun renderState(state: MessageComposerState)
```

The file containing `MessageComposerView` can be found [here](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/blob/main/stream-chat-android-ui-components/src/main/kotlin/io/getstream/chat/android/ui/feature/messages/composer/MessageComposerView.kt).

Let's take a look at `MessageComposerState`:

```kotlin
public data class MessageComposerState(
    ..., // State
    val ownCapabilities: Set<String> = setOf()
)
```

The file containing `MessageComposerState` can be found [here](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/blob/main/stream-chat-android-ui-common/src/main/kotlin/io/getstream/chat/android/ui/common/state/messages/composer/MessageComposerState.kt).

`MessageComposerView` regulates the following capabilities:

- **send-message * **
- **send-links * **
- **upload-file * **
- **send-typing-events * **

:::note
Own capabilities are publicly exposed inside `MessageComposerController` and `MessageComposerViewModel` as `ownCapabilities: StateFlow<Set<String>>`.

For this component, as well as all the other examples, the capabilities in bold are a part of the "default" behavior that is set up for most users in the dashboard.

### ChannelListView

If you use our `ChannelListView` as is, no further action is needed as it is set up to use own
capabilities.

It regulates the following capabilities.

- **leave-channel * **
- delete-channel

`ChannelListView` contains the following function:

```kotlin
public fun setMoreOptionsClickListener(listener: ChannelClickListener?)
```

Should you wish to use it in order to override the default behavior, you will have to implement a UI capable of
correctly using own capabilities.

### Other capabilities

There are channel capabilities that are not implemented in the SDK because we do not offer the corresponding components
or the functionality.
You can implement these yourself after creating the correct components.

These are as follows:

- freeze-channel
- set-channel-cooldown
- update-channel
- update-channel-members
- search-messages

Please note that while we do offer a search component, its functionality is not simple enough to be regulated by the 'search-messages' capability.

# How capabilities affect the UI

Let's take `MessageComposerView` into consideration.
If we left it with the default, empty set of own capabilities we would get the following result:

|![MessageComposerView with empty capabilities](../../assets/own_capabilities_message_composer_view_empty_capabilities.png)|
|---|

This leaves the user unable to perform any action provided by `MessageComposerView`.
Ideally, you should let your Dashboard App settings regulate capabilities, but if you wish to control them manually, you can do so.

Take a look at the object called `ChannelCapabilities`:

```kotlin
public object ChannelCapabilities {
    /** Ability to ban channel members. */
    public const val BAN_CHANNEL_MEMBERS: String = "ban-channel-members"
    ... // Other capabilities
}
```
The file containing `ChannelCapabilities` can be found [here](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/blob/main/stream-chat-android-client/src/main/java/io/getstream/chat/android/client/models/ChannelCapabilities.kt).

This object contains all relevant channel capabilities as type safe properties.
You can use the properties to build a set containing only the capabilities you want enabled for the user.

If you were to enable the user to send messages, links, attachments and typing events, you would build a set as follows:

```kotlin
val customOwnCapabilities = setOf(
    ChannelCapabilities.SEND_MESSAGE,
    ChannelCapabilities.SEND_LINKS,
    ChannelCapabilities.UPLOAD_FILE,
    ChannelCapabilities.SEND_TYPING_EVENTS
)
```

Then use it to create `MessageComposerState`:

```kotlin
val messageComposerState = MessageComposerState(
    ownCapabilities = customOwnCapabilities
)
```

And finally call the `MessageComposerView::renderState` method with `messageComposerState` parameter:

```kotlin
messageComposerView.renderState(messageComposerState)
```
This enables the following capabilities:

- **send-message * **
- **send-links * **
- **upload-file * **
- **send-typing-events * **

And results in `MessageComposerView` having the following appearance:

|![MessageComposerView with custom capabilities](../../assets/own_capabilities_message_composer_view_with_capabilities.png)|
|---|

:::note
Please note that providing custom client side capabilities leaves you in charge of making sure that users are not awarded with dangerous capabilities and that different clients are in sync.
This is why it is recommended to fetch own capabilities that are provided to you by the server.
