# Attachment Gallery

`AttachmentGalleryActivity` is an Activity used to display attachments that the users have sent in the chat. It is an image gallery where users can view, share, and download the pictures, and use a menu to easily navigate through them.

| Light Mode | Dark Mode |
| --- | --- |
|![attachment_gallery_example1_light](../../assets/attachment_gallery_example1_light.png)|![attachment_gallery_example1_dark](../../assets/attachment_gallery_example1_dark.png)|
|![attachment_gallery_example2_light](../../assets/attachment_gallery_example2_light.png)|![attachment_gallery_example2_dark](../../assets/attachment_gallery_example2_dark.png)|

## Handling Actions

There are four user actions that can be customized by the following handlers:

- `AttachmentReplyOptionHandler`
- `AttachmentShowInChatOptionHandler`
- `AttachmentDownloadOptionHandler`
- `AttachmentDeleteOptionHandler`

These are called when the user selects one of the options from the overflow menu in the top right:

|Light|Dark| 
|---|---|
|![attachment_gallery_example2_light](../../assets/attachment_activity_menu_dark.png)|![attachment_gallery_example2_light](../../assets/attachment_activity_menu_light.png)|

As the gallery is usually opened from `MessageListView`, you can set these handlers on that View the following way:

```kotlin
messageListView.setAttachmentReplyOptionClickHandler { resultItem ->
    resultItem.messageId
    // Handle reply to attachment
}

messageListView.setAttachmentShowInChatOptionClickHandler { resultItem ->
    resultItem.messageId
    // Handle show in chat
}

messageListView.setDownloadOptionHandler { resultItem ->
    resultItem.assetUrl
    // Handle download the attachment
}

messageListView.setAttachmentDeleteOptionClickHandler { resultItem ->
    resultItem.assetUrl
    resultItem.imageUrl
    // Handle delete
}
```

## Navigating To Attachment Gallery

By default, the Attachment Gallery is opened when a user clicks on an attachment in `MessageListView`. In that case, all actions mentioned above have a default implementation, which can be changed by overriding `MessageListView`'s handlers.

You can also navigate to `AttachmentGalleryActivity` manually from anywhere else in your code. In this case, you will need to implement all available actions:

```kotlin
// Create Attachment Gallery Destination
val destination = AttachmentGalleryDestination(
    requireContext(),
    attachmentReplyOptionHandler = { resultItem ->
        // Handle reply
    },
    attachmentShowInChatOptionHandler = { resultItem ->
        // Handle show image in chat
    },
    attachmentDownloadOptionHandler = { resultItem ->
        // Handle download image
    },
    attachmentDeleteOptionClickHandler = { resultItem ->
        // Handle delete image
    },
)

// Register destination with the ActivityResultRegistry
activity?.activityResultRegistry?.let { registry ->
    destination.register(registry)
}

// Set the data to display
destination.setData(attachmentGalleryItems = listOf(), attachmentIndex = 0)

// Fire the navigation request
ChatUI.navigator.navigate(destination)
```
