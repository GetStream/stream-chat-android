# ChannelsScreen

Previously, `ChannelsScreen` component was internally creating `ChannelViewModelFactory` by utilizing the given component parameters.
In the new version, you are required to provide a `ChannelViewModelFactory` instance to `ChannelsScreen`, which will be used for creating the required ViewModels.

## Component Parameters

Since the `ChannelViewModelFactory` is passed directly to the `ChannelsScreen` component, the following parameters were removed from `ChannelsScreen` component:
- `filters: FilterObject? = null` - Default filters for channels. By passing in `null` to the ViewModel, we show messaging channels where the current user is a member.
- `querySort: QuerySorter<Channel> = QuerySortByField.descByName("last_updated")` - Default query sort for channels.
- `channelLimit: Int = ChannelListViewModel.DEFAULT_CHANNEL_LIMIT` - The limit of channels queried per page.
- `memberLimit: Int = ChannelListViewModel.DEFAULT_MEMBER_LIMIT` - The limit of members requested per channel.
- `messageLimit: Int = ChannelListViewModel.DEFAULT_MESSAGE_LIMIT` - The limit of messages requested per channel item.

The `ChannelsScreen` signature in **v5** looked like this:

```kotlin
@Composable
public fun ChannelsScreen(
    filters: FilterObject? = null,
    querySort: QuerySorter<Channel> = QuerySortByField.descByName("last_updated"),
    title: String = "Stream Chat",
    isShowingHeader: Boolean = true,
    isShowingSearch: Boolean = false,
    channelLimit: Int = ChannelListViewModel.DEFAULT_CHANNEL_LIMIT,
    memberLimit: Int = ChannelListViewModel.DEFAULT_MEMBER_LIMIT,
    messageLimit: Int = ChannelListViewModel.DEFAULT_MESSAGE_LIMIT,
    onHeaderActionClick: () -> Unit = {},
    onHeaderAvatarClick: () -> Unit = {},
    onItemClick: (Channel) -> Unit = {},
    onViewChannelInfoAction: (Channel) -> Unit = {},
    onBackPressed: () -> Unit = {},
)
```

And the signature of `ChannelsScreen` in **v6** looks like this:
```kotlin
@Composable
public fun ChannelsScreen(
    viewModelFactory: ChannelViewModelFactory = ChannelViewModelFactory(),
    title: String = "Stream Chat",
    isShowingHeader: Boolean = true,
    isShowingSearch: Boolean = false,
    onHeaderActionClick: () -> Unit = {},
    onHeaderAvatarClick: () -> Unit = {},
    onItemClick: (Channel) -> Unit = {},
    onViewChannelInfoAction: (Channel) -> Unit = {},
    onBackPressed: () -> Unit = {},
)
```
