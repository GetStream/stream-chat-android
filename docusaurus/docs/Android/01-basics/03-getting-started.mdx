# Getting Started

Let's see how you can get started with the Android Chat SDK after adding the required [dependencies](./02-dependencies.mdx). This page shows you how to initialize the SDK in your app.

### Creating a ChatClient

Your first step is initializing the `ChatClient`, which is the main entry point for all operations in the library. `ChatClient` is a singleton: you'll create it once and re-use it across your application.

A best practice is to initialize `ChatClient` in the `Application` class:

 ```kotlin
 class App : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        val chatClient = ChatClient.Builder("apiKey", context).build()
    }
}
 ```

The _Builder_ for `ChatClient` exposes configuration options for features such as [Logging](./05-logging.mdx).

:::note
To generate an API key, you can sign up for a [free 30-day trial](https://getstream.io/chat/trial/). You can then access your api key in the [Dashboard](https://getstream.io/dashboard).
:::

If you create the `ChatClient` instance following the pattern in the previous example, you will be able to access that instance from any part of your application using the `instance()` method:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        val chatClient = ChatClient.instance() // Returns the singleton instance
    }
}
```

### Adding the Offline Plugin

If you want to have offline support or **use the UI Components package**, you'll need to initialize the `OfflinePlugin` class and add it to the `ChatClient.Builder`. You can skip this initialization step if you're only using the low-level client.

The initialization should be done using `StreamOfflinePluginFactory`:

```kotlin
val offlinePluginFactory = StreamOfflinePluginFactory(
    config = Config(
        // Enables the background sync which is performed to sync user actions done without the Internet connection.
        backgroundSyncEnabled = true,
        // Enables the ability to receive information about user activity such as last active date and if they are online right now.
        userPresence = true,
        // Enables using the database as an internal caching mechanism.
        persistenceEnabled = true,
        // An enumeration of various network types used as a constraint inside upload attachments worker.
        uploadAttachmentsNetworkType = UploadAttachmentsNetworkType.NOT_ROAMING,
    ),
    appContext = context,
)

ChatClient.Builder(apiKey, context).withPlugin(offlinePluginFactory).build()
```

For more about working with `OfflinePlugin`, see [Offline Support](../02-client/06-guides/06-offline-support.mdx)

### Connecting a User

The next step is connecting the user. This requires a valid Stream Chat token. As you must use your `API_SECRET` to create this token, it is unsafe to generate this token outside of a secure server.

```kotlin
val user = User(
    id = "bender",
    name = "Bender",
    image = "https://bit.ly/321RmWb",
)

ChatClient.instance().connectUser(user = user, token = "userToken") // Replace with a real token
    .enqueue { result ->
        if (result.isSuccess) {
            // Handle success
        } else {
            // Handle error
        }
    }
```

:::note
To learn about how to create a token and different user types, see [Tokens & Authentication](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/android/tokens_and_authentication/?language=kotlin).
:::

If the `connectUser` call was successful, you are now ready to use the SDK! ðŸŽ‰

The methods of the `ChatClient` class allow you to create channels, send messages, add reactions, and perform many more low-level operations. You can also use the SDK's pre-built UI Components that will perform data fetching and sending for you, as described below.

### Adding UI Components

There are two UI Component implementations available: one built on regular, XML based Android Views, and another built from the ground up in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

Take a look at the Overview pages of the implementations to get started with them:
- [XML based UI Components](../03-ui/01-overview.mdx)
- [Jetpack Compose UI Components](../04-compose/01-overview.mdx)
