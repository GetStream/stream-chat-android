_spaceship_ exposes both the Apple Developer Center and the App Store Connect API. Itâ€™s super fast, well tested and supports all of the operations you can do via the browser. It powers parts of _fastlane_, and can be leveraged for more advanced _fastlane_ features. Scripting your Developer Center workflow has never been easier!

# What's spaceship?

_spaceship_ uses a combination of [5 different API endpoints](#api-endpoints), used by the Apple Developer Portal and Xcode. As no API offers everything we need, spaceship combines all APIs for you. [More details about the APIs](#technical-details).

- Blazing fast communication using only a HTTP client
- Object oriented access to all resources
- Resistant against front-end design changes of the of the Apple Developer Portal
- One central tool for the communication
- Automatic re-trying of requests in case a timeout occurs
- No web scraping
- 90%+ test coverage by stubbing server responses

More details about why spaceship is useful on [spaceship.airforce](https://spaceship.airforce).

> No matter how many apps or certificates you have, spaceship **can** handle your scale.

## Example spaceship code

```ruby
Spaceship.login

# Create a new app
app = Spaceship.app.create!(bundle_id: "com.krausefx.app", name: "Spaceship App")

# Use an existing certificate
cert = Spaceship.certificate.production.all.first

# Create a new provisioning profile
profile = Spaceship.provisioning_profile.app_store.create!(bundle_id: app.bundle_id,
                                                         certificate: cert)

# Print the name and download the new profile
puts("Created Profile " + profile.name)
profile.download
```

## Speed

Before _spaceship_, the [fastlane tools](https://fastlane.tools) used web scraping to interact with Apple's web services. With spaceship it is possible to directly access the underlying APIs using a simple HTTP client only.

Using spaceship, the execution time of [_sigh_](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/sigh/) was reduced from over 1 minute to less than 5 seconds.

# Installation

_spaceship_ is part of _fastlane_:

    gem install fastlane

# Usage

## Playground

To try _spaceship_, just run `fastlane spaceship`. It will automatically start the `spaceship playground`. It makes it super easy to try _spaceship_ :rocket:

![assets/docs/Playground.png](assets/docs/Playground.png)

This requires you to install `pry` using `gem install pry`. `pry` is not installed by default, as most [_fastlane_](https://fastlane.tools) users won't need the `spaceship playground`. You can add the `pry` dependency to your `Gemfile`.

## Apple Developer Portal API

Open [DeveloperPortal.md](docs/DeveloperPortal.md) for code samples

## App Store Connect API

Open [AppStoreConnect.md](docs/AppStoreConnect.md) for code samples

## 2 Step Verification

When your Apple account has 2 factor verification enabled, you'll automatically be asked to verify your identity. If you have a trusted device configured for your account, then a code will appear on the device. If you don't have any devices configured, but have trusted a phone number, then a code will be sent to your phone. The resulting session will be stored in `~/.fastlane/spaceship/[email]/cookie`. The session should be valid for about one month, however there is no way to test this without actually waiting for over a month.

### Support for CI machines

#### Web sessions

See [Best Practices > Continuous Integration > Authenticating with Apple services > Method 2: Two-step or two-factor authentication > Storing a manually verified session using spaceauth](https://docs.fastlane.tools/best-practices/continuous-integration/#storing-a-manually-verified-session-using-spaceauth)

#### Transporter

See [Best Practices > Continuous Integration > Authenticating with Apple services > Method 3: Application-specific passwords](https://docs.fastlane.tools/best-practices/continuous-integration/#method-3-application-specific-passwords)

## _spaceship_ in use

All [fastlane tools](https://fastlane.tools) that communicate with Apple's web services in some way, use _spaceship_ to do so.

# Technical Details

## API Endpoints

Overview of the used API endpoints

- `https://idmsa.apple.com`:
  - Used to authenticate to get a valid session
- `https://developerservices2.apple.com`:
  - Get a list of all available provisioning profiles
  - Register new devices
- `https://developer.apple.com`:
  - List all devices, certificates, apps and app groups
  - Create new certificates, provisioning profiles and apps
  - Disable/enable services on apps and assign them to app groups
  - Delete certificates and apps
  - Repair provisioning profiles
  - Download provisioning profiles
  - Team selection
- `https://appstoreconnect.apple.com`:
  - Managing apps
  - Managing beta testers
  - Submitting updates to review
  - Managing app metadata
- `https://du-itc.appstoreconnect.apple.com`:
  - Upload icons, screenshots, trailers ...
- `https://is[1-9]-ssl.mzstatic.com`:
  - Download app screenshots from App Store Connect

_spaceship_ uses all those API points to offer this seamless experience.

## Magic involved

_spaceship_ does a lot of magic to get everything working so neatly:

- **Sensible Defaults**: You only have to provide the mandatory information (e.g. new provisioning profiles contain all devices by default)
- **Local Validation**: When pushing changes back to the Apple Developer Portal _spaceship_ will make sure only valid data is sent to Apple (e.g. automatic repairing of provisioning profiles)
- **Various request/response types**: When working with the different API endpoints, _spaceship_ has to deal with `JSON`, `XML`, `txt`, `plist` and sometimes even `HTML` responses and requests.
- **Automatic Pagination**: Even if you have thousands of apps, profiles or certificates, _spaceship_ **can** handle your scale. It was heavily tested by first using _spaceship_ to create hundreds of profiles and then accessing them using _spaceship_.
- **Session, Cookie and CSRF token**: All the security aspects are handled by _spaceship_.
- **Profile Magic**: Create and upload code signing requests, all managed by _spaceship_
- **Multiple Spaceship**: You can launch multiple _spaceships_ with different Apple accounts to do things like syncing the registered devices.
