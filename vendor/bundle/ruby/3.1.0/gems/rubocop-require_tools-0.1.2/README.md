# Require tools for Rubocop

This is an extension for rubocop. It contains tools to analyze your code and work with require statements. Currently it will only check whether there are possibly any missing requires in your code. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rubocop-require_tools'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Then, require this extension in your project's `.rubocop.yml`:

```YAML
require: rubocop-require_tools
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
