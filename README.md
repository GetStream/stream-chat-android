This is the official Android SDK for [Stream Chat](https://getstream.io/chat/sdk/android/), a service for building chat and messaging applications. This library includes both a low-level chat SDK and a set of reusable UI components. Most users start with the UI components, and fall back to the lower level API when they want to customize things.

The SDK supports both Kotlin and Java, but *we strongly recommend using Kotlin*.

## 📖 Tutorial

The best place to start is the [Android In-App Messaging Tutorial](https://getstream.io/tutorials/android-chat/). It teaches you the basics of using this SDK and also shows how to make frequently required changes.

## 🛠️ Installation and Getting Started 🚀

See the [Dependencies](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/android/basics/dependencies/) and [Getting Started](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/android/basics/getting-started/) pages of the documentation.

## 📲 Sample App

This repo includes a fully functional [example app](/stream-chat-android-ui-components-sample) featuring threads, reactions, typing indicators, optimistic UI updates and offline storage. To run the sample app, start by cloning this repo:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:GetStream/stream-chat-android.git
```

Next, open [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and open the newly created project folder. You'll want to run the [`stream-chat-android-ui-components-sample`](/stream-chat-android-ui-components-sample) app.

## 🏗️ Jetpack Compose Sample App

We also have a UI implementation built in Jetpack Compose available, currently in a beta version.

This also comes with its own [example app](/stream-chat-android-compose-sample), which you can try by cloning this repo, and then running the app in the [`stream-chat-android-compose-sample`](/stream-chat-android-compose-sample) module.

As this is a beta, we're eager to hear your feedback. Join us in [this repo's discussions](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-android/discussions) or tweet at us [@getstream_io](https://twitter.com/getstream_io)!
