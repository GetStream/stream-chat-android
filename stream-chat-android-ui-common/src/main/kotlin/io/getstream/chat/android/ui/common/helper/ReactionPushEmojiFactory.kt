/**
 * Factory that creates emojis to be displayed in the push notifications delivered for message reactions.
 * Example:
 * ```kotlin
 * class CustomPushEmojiFactory : ReactionPushEmojiFactory {
 *
 *   override fun emojiCode(type: String): String? {
 *       return when (type) {
 *         "like" -> "👍"
 *         "love" -> null
 *         else -> null
 *       }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * With the above implementation, a "like" reaction will show a thumbs up emoji in the push notification:
 * `Reacted 👍 to "Your message"`.
 *
 * A "love" reaction will show the reaction type as text instead of an emoji:
 * `Reacted :love: to "Your message"`.
 *
 * Important: To use this feature, you must migrate you project to use Push V3 in the Stream Dashboard.
 *
 * See [Overview](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/android/push_introduction/) and
 * [Legacy Push System](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/android/legacy_push_system/).
